Bonner, Attorney\r\n\r\n\r\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nThe Veteran\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nJ. J. Tang, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from March 1970 to December 1971, and from December 1990 to May 1991.  He had additional service in the Reserve. \r\n\r\nThis case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2011 rating decision by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll documents on the Virtual VA paperless claims processing system and the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) have been reviewed, to include a transcript of the February 2017 Board hearing presided over by the undersigned Veterans Law Judge. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran and the above-mentioned attorney are hereby notified that the above-mentioned attorney will not be the Veteran's authorized representative of record upon transfer of this case to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  Here, the Veteran executed a Form 21-22a in 2014 appointing the above-mentioned attorney as his authorized attorney, and the attorney limited her representation to the issues on appeal.  Also, the attorney assisted the Veteran at his February 2017 Board hearing regarding these claims on appeal.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's appeal was certified and transferred to the Board in 2015.  Then, in March 2017, the Veteran executed a VA Form 21-22 appointing the North Carolina Division of Veterans Affairs as his representative, and this appointment had no limitations in representation.  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 20.1304(b)(2017), any request for a change of representation after 90-days from the date of certification of his appeal to the Board should be submitted to the Board with a good cause explanation.  The Board may not accept this change of representation at this time because there was no good cause explanation for the change in representation as to the claims on appeal.  However, as a matter of law, the new appointment of the North Carolina Division of Veterans Affairs will be recognized upon transfer of the case to the AOJ.\r\n\r\nThe entitlement to service connection issues listed above are addressed in the REMAND portion of the decision below and are REMANDED to the AOJ. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  In an April 2005 rating decision, the RO denied the claims for service connection for PTSD, based on the determination that there is no medical evidence of PTSD; for memory loss as due to Gulf War service, based on the determination that there is no medical evidence of memory loss or a chronic undiagnosed illness; for a back disability, based on the determination that there is no medical evidence of a back disability; and, for migraines, based on the determination that headaches were not caused or aggravated by a period of active service.  \r\n\r\n2.  In an October 2006 rating decision, the RO declined to reopen the previously denied claim for service connection for memory loss as due to Gulf War service, based on the determination that no evidence that was new and material to the claim for service connection for memory loss had been submitted. \r\n\r\n3.  In a February 2010 rating decision,  the RO declined to reopen the previously denied claim for service connection for PTSD, based on the determination that no evidence that was new and material to the claim for service connection for PTSD had been submitted. \r\n\r\n4.  The Veteran did not submit a notice of disagreement against the April 2005 rating decision, and there was no evidence or information received within one year of its issuance that was new and material to the claims for service connection for a back disability or for migraines.  \r\n\r\n5.  The Veteran did not submit a notice of disagreement against the October 2006 rating decision, and there was no evidence or information received within one year of its issuance that was new and material to the claim for service connection for memory loss.\r\n\r\n6.  The Veteran did not submit a notice of disagreement against the February 2010 rating decision, and there was no evidence or information received within one year of its issuance that was new and material to the claim for service connection for PTSD.\r\n3.  Respective to each previously denied claim, assuming its credibility for the purposes of reopening, the additional evidence received since the April 2005, October 2006, and February 2010 rating decisions was not previously considered in such decisions and raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claims for service connection for PTSD, memory loss, a back disability, and migraines.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1.  The April 2005 rating decision, which denied the claim for service connection for a back disability and for migraines, is final.  38 U.S.C.A. \u00c2\u00a7 7105(c) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103 (2005).\r\n\r\n2.  The October 2006 rating decision, which declined to reopen the previously denied claim for service connection for memory loss, is final.  38 U.S.C.A. \u00c2\u00a7 7105(c) (West 2006); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103 (2006).\r\n\r\n3.  The February 2010 rating decision, which declined to reopen the previously denied claim for service connection for PTSD, is final.  38 U.S.C.A. \u00c2\u00a7 7105(c) (West 2010); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103 (2010).\r\n\r\n2.  Respective to each previously denied claim, the additional evidence received since the April 2005, October 2006, and February 2010 rating decisions is new and material to the claims for service connection for PTSD, memory loss, a back disability, and migraines, and these claims are reopened.  38 U.S.C.A. \u00c2\u00a7 5108 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.156(a) (2017).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nBecause the Board is reopening the previously denied claims for service connection that are on appeal, discussion concerning compliance with the duties to notify and assist is not necessary with regard to these claims to reopen. \r\n\r\nApplications to Reopen \r\n\r\nGenerally, an unappealed decision of the RO is final  U.S.C.. \u00c2\u00a7 7105(c), 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103. An exception to this rule is 38 U.S.C.A. \u00c2\u00a7 5108 , which provides that if new and material evidence is presented or secured with respect to a claim which has been disallowed, VA shall reopen the claim and review the former disposition of the claim.\r\n\r\nNew and material evidence is defined as evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers which bears directly and substantially upon the specific matter under consideration; such new and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence previously of record, and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim. 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.156 (a).\r\n\r\n The Board will generally presume the credibility of the evidence in determining whether evidence is new and material. Justus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 512-513   (1992). Significantly, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has held that evidence that is merely cumulative of other evidence in the record cannot be new and material even if that evidence had not been previously presented to the Board. Anglin v. West, 203 F.3d 1343 (2000).\r\n\r\n In deciding whether new and material evidence has been submitted the Board looks to the evidence submitted since the last final denial of the claim on any basis. Evans v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 273, 285   (1996). The threshold for determining whether new and material evidence raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating a claim is \"low.\" See Shade v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 110, 117 (2010).\r\n\r\nAs noted in the Findings of Fact above, the Veteran's claim for service connection for a back disability and migraines was denied in an April 2005 rating decision.  The additional evidence received since the April 2005 rating decision includes the Veteran's Board hearing testimony that his back disability is related to an injury that happened during a period of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) when serving in the Reserve.  Evidence that tends to indicate that a back disability is related to an injury that may have been incurred during a period of active service is pertinent evidence that was absent at the time of the April 2005 decision, and assuming its credibility for the purposes of reopening, this evidence raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim for service connection for a back disability.  Also, the additional evidence received since the April 2005 rating decision includes the Veteran's Board hearing testimony that he had headaches that began during his first period of active duty, and that such headaches continued since onset in active duty.  He also testified that he was diagnosed with migraines during a period of ACDUTRA in Arizona.  Evidence that tends to indicate that a headache disability began in active service and continued since active service is pertinent evidence that was absent at the time of the April 2005 decision, and this evidence raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim for service connection for migraines. \r\n\r\nAs noted in the Findings of Fact above, the RO declined to reopen the Veteran's previously denied claim for service connection for memory loss in an October 2006 rating decision.  The additional evidence received since the October 2006 rating decision includes the Veteran's Board hearing testimony that his memory loss began after his deployment to the Middle East, and that his memory loss symptoms have continued since that time.  Assuming its credibility for the purposes of reopening, this evidence that tends to indicate that the Veteran may have had an organic disease of the nervous system manifested by memory loss symptoms that continued since service is pertinent evidence that was absent at the time of the October 2006 decision, and this evidence raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim for memory loss. \r\n\r\nAs noted in the Findings of Fact above, the RO declined to reopen the Veteran's previously denied claim for service connection for PTSD in an February 2010 rating decision.  The additional evidence received since the February 2010 rating decision includes the Veteran's Board hearing testimony that he experience fear of hostile military or terrorist activity when serving in the Persian Gulf - specifically fear of landmines and IEDs when serving as a truck driver during active duty.  Evidence that tends to indicate that a psychiatric disability is etiologically related to the in-service stressor of fear of hostile military or terrorist activity is pertinent evidence that was absent at the time of the February 2010 rating decision, and assuming its credibility for the purposes of reopening, this evidence raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim for PTSD. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the Board finds that new and material evidence has been submitted, and the claims for service connection for a back disability, migraines, PTSD, and memory loss are reopened.  Although the evidence is sufficient to reopen, it is not sufficient to grant the claims, and the claims on the merits are discussed in the Remand below. \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nAs new and material evidence has been submitted to reopen a previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, this claim is reopened. \r\n\r\nAs new and material evidence has been submitted to reopen a previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for memory loss, this claim is reopened. \r\n\r\nAs new and material evidence has been submitted to reopen a previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for a back disability, this claim is reopened. \r\n\r\nAs new and material evidence has been submitted to reopen a previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for migraines, this claim is reopened. \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nPsychiatric disorder and memory loss\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he has a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, anxiety, and adjustment disorder, that is related to his service in the Persian Gulf.  He also contends that he has memory loss is related to his service in the Persian Gulf.  He testified at the Board hearing that he began experiencing psychiatric symptoms and memory loss after his deployment.  He testified at the Board hearing that he experienced fear of hostile military or terrorist activity when serving in the Persian Gulf - specifically fear of landmines and IEDs when serving as a truck driver during his second period of active duty.  The Veteran also reported that during active duty in the Persian Gulf, his trucking unit would move in after the infantry to retrieve damaged equipment and vehicles, and that he observed that the Iraqis did not bury their dead, so his unit had to get U.S. engineers to dig a hole for all the bodies.

The Board also notes that the Veteran reported in December 2004 that his back disability began in about 1989, and that he received treatment for the back in Saudi Arabia.  The Veteran also submitted lay statements, to include from a fellow serviceman, reflecting that he experienced backache during his second period of active duty service.  The Veteran should be afforded a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his back disability.  \r\n\r\nThe record shows that treatment records from Kannaoplis Internal Medicine dating from February 12, 2004 to July 5, 2004 are associated with the claims file.  Attempts should be made to obtain any available and relevant treatment records dating before and after these dates.
