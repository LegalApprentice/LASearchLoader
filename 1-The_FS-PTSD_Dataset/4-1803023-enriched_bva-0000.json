Thompson, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1965 to December 1967.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2008 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Jackson, Mississippi. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified at a Travel Board hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in April 2015.  A transcript of that hearing has been associated with the claims file.  \r\n\r\nThis matter was remanded by the Board in July 2015 for further development and has since been returned to the Board for appellate review.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal was processed using the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) paperless claims processing system and Legacy Content Manager (LCM) claims file.  LCM contains documents that are either duplicative of the evidence in VBMS or not relevant to the issue on appeal. \r\n\r\nThe issue of entitlement to TDIU is addressed in the REMAND portion of the decision below and is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nFor the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's PTSD has been characterized by occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in work, family relations, and mood, without an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nResolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, for the entire period on appeal, the criteria for an initial evaluation of 70 percent, but no higher, for PTSD are met.  38 U.S.C.A. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1155, 5103, 5107(b) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 3.102, 3.159, 4.3, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411 (2016).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Duties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is challenging the evaluation assigned in connection with the grant of service connection for PTSD.  Where an underlying claim has been granted and there is disagreement as to \"downstream\" questions, the claim has been substantiated, and there is no need to provide additional \u00c2\u00a7 5103 notice or prejudice from absent notice.  Hartman v. Nicholson, 483 F.3d 1311, 1314-15  (Fed. Cir. 2007); VAOPGCPREC 8-2003 (Dec. 22, 2003).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the duty to assist the Veteran has also been satisfied in this case.  The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) as well as all identified and available post-service medical records are in the claims file.  The Veteran has not identified any available, outstanding records that are relevant to the claims decided herein.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded VA examination in October 2008, October 2010, and June 2012, and January 2017.  The Board finds that the VA examination reports and opinions when taken together, are adequate to decide the case because they are predicated on a review of the claims file, as well as on an examination during which a history was solicited from the Veteran.  In addition, these examinations, when taken together, fully address the rating criteria that are relevant to rating the disability in this case.  Moreover, there is no objective evidence indicating that there has been a material change in the severity of the Veteran's service-connected disability since he was last examined.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.327(a) (2017).  The duty to assist does not require that a claim be remanded solely because of the passage of time since an otherwise adequate VA examination was conducted.  Palczewski v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 174 (2007) (noting that the passage of time alone, without an allegation of worsening, does not warrant a new examination); VAOPGCPREC 11-95 (April 7, 1995).  Based on the foregoing, there is adequate medical evidence of record to make a determination in this case.  Accordingly, the Board finds that VA's duty to assist with respect to obtaining a VA examination or opinion with respect to the issues on appeal has been met. For these reasons, the Board concludes that VA has fulfilled the duty to assist the Veteran in this case.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was also provided with an opportunity to set forth his contentions during the hearing before a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).  A Decision Review Officer or VLJ who chairs a hearing must fulfill two duties: (1) duty to fully explain the issues; and (2) the duty to suggest the submission of evidence that may have been overlooked.  38 C.F.R 3.103(c)(2) (2016); Byrant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488, 496-97 (2010).  At the Board hearing, the VLJ outlined the issue on appeal and the hearing focused on the elements necessary to substantiate the claim.  Additionally, additional subsequent development was conducted based on deficiencies in the record.  As such, the Board finds that the VLJ complied with the duties set for in 38 C.F.R. 3.103(c)(2) (2016).  There has been no allegation to the contrary.  The Board will proceed to address the merits of the claim.  \r\n\r\nThe Board also finds compliance with the Board's prior remand directives.  This case was remanded by the Board in July 2015.  The July 2015 Board remand requested that the RO obtain VA treatment records form February 2012 onward, contact the Veteran and afford him the opportunity to identify private treatment providers, develop and adjudicate the Veteran's claim for TDIU, afford the Veteran a VA examination to determine the current severity of the Veteran's PTSD, and to readjudicate the claim for increased rating of PTSD.  VA treatment records were received in December 2015 and February 2017.  Correspondence regarding development of the TDIU claim was mailed to the Veteran in November 2015.  The Veteran sent an application for increased compensation based on unemployability in February 2016.  The claim for increased rating for PTSD was readjudicated in January 2017.  The RO received new evidence and again readjudicated the claim in February 2017.  The claim for TDIU was adjudicated in February 2016, January 2017 and February 2017 (after the receipt of new evidence).  Accordingly, additional remand is not warranted.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).  The Board will proceed to address the merits of the claim.\r\n\r\nII.  Increased Evaluation for PTSD\r\n\r\nThe Veteran seeks an initial evaluation higher than 30 percent for service connected PTSD.  Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the Veteran's symptomatology with the criteria set for the in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1155 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.1 (2017).  Separate diagnostic codes identify various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.1 (2017).  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.3 (2017).\r\n\r\nFor an appeal of an initial disability evaluation, the Veteran's entire medical history is to be considered.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  When a claimant disagrees with an initially assigned disability evaluation, the Board is required to consider whether the Veteran is entitled to separate evaluations for distinct periods based on the facts found during the appeal period, a practice known as \"staged ratings.\"  Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126-27; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service-connected PTSD is rated under 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.130, DC 9411 (20167.  That DC uses the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, which provides for a 30 percent rating for occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, and/or mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events).\r\n\r\nA 50 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing effective work and social relationships.  Id.\r\n\r\nA 70 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id.\r\n\r\nA 100 percent rating is warranted for a mental disorder when there is total occupational and social impairment due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name. Id.\r\n\r\nGlobal Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale scores are based on a scale indicating the psychological, social, and occupational functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental health-illness.  Carpenter v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 240 (1995); Richard v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 266 (1996); American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 4th Ed. (1994) (DSM-IV).\r\n\r\nThe GAF score is based on all of the Veteran's psychiatric impairments. A GAF score of 31 to 40 indicates some impairment in reality testing or communication (e.g., speech is at times illogical, obscure, or irrelevant), or a major impairment in several areas, such as work or school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood (e.g., depressed man avoids friends, neglects family, and is unable to work).  A GAF score of 41 to 50 indicates serious symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe obsessional rituals, frequent shoplifting) or any serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., no friends, unable to keep a job).  A GAF score of 51 to 60 represents moderate symptoms (e.g., flat affect and circumstantial speech, occasional panic attacks) or moderate difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., few friends, conflicts with coworkers).  A GAF score of 61 to 70 represents mild symptoms (e.g., depressed mood and mild insomnia) or some difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., occasional truancy, or theft within the household), but generally functioning pretty well, and has some meaningful interpersonal relationships.  While particular GAF scores are not contained in the VA schedule of ratings for mental disorders, they are a useful tool in assessing a veteran's disability and assigning ratings.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.130 (2017).  However, they are just one of many factors considered when determining a rating.\r\n\r\nThe specified factors for each rating for mental disorders are examples, rather than requirements, for that particular rating.  The Board will not limit its analysis solely to whether a veteran exhibited the symptoms listed in the rating criteria.  The Board will instead focus on the level of occupation and social impairment caused by the symptoms.  Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).  However, \"[w]ithout those examples, differentiating a 30% evaluation from a 50% evaluation would be extremely ambiguous.\"  Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 44.  The list of examples \"provides guidance as to the severity of symptoms contemplated for each rating.\"  Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 442.  Each particular rating \"requires sufficient symptoms of the kind listed in the requirements, or others of similar severity, frequency or duration, that cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas such as those enumerated in the regulation.\"  Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).\r\n\r\nWhen evaluating a mental disorder, the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms; the length of remissions; and the veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission must be considered.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.126(a) (2017).  In addition, the evaluation must be based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment, rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination.  Id.  Further, when evaluation the level of disability from a mental disorder, the extent of social impairment in considered, but the rating cannot be assigned solely on the basis of social impairment.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.126(b) (2017).\r\n\r\nIn May 2008 VA treatment record the Veteran stated that he works as a truck mechanic in a small shop, so that he doesn't have to deal with others.  The Veteran enjoys the solitude, it reduces his chances of becoming angry about something.  The Veteran admits to problems with mild insomnia, hypervigilance, avoidance of issues related to his combat experiences, anger, inappropriate rage, and depression.  The medical provider observed that the Veteran's mood was anxious with congruent affect; thought process was linear; appropriately dressed and groomed; no delusions or hallucinations; and no suicidal or homicidal ideations.  The medical provider noted that the Veteran had good short and long-term memory; an organized and logical thought process; and problems with depression, PTSD, sleep stage disturbances, and rage.  The medical provider assigned a GAF of 50, which indicates serious symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe obsessional rituals, frequent shoplifting) or any serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., no friends, unable to keep a job).  \r\n\r\nIn the October 2008 VA examination report, the Veteran reported that he has worked for the gentleman that he now works for 40 years as a mechanic.  The Veteran stated that he never misses work and that work keeps him occupied.  The Veteran stated that he likes working alone, which he does.  The Veteran reported hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and nightmares related to service in Vietnam.  The nightmares vary sometimes from not having during the week to two to three times in a week.  The Veteran stated that his nightmares are typically triggered by things such as seeing a movie or news about the war or hearing somebody discuss the war.  The Veteran reported that he has had very poor sleep for years.  The Veteran stated that he will sleep continuously for two to three hours, then wake up frequently after that.  The Veteran reported feeling nervous and edgy.  The Veteran stated that he has problems being close to people outside of his wife of almost 40 years, has no friends, and does not tolerate crowds.  He reported a good relationship with his wife.  The Veteran stated that he has problems with irritability.  The Veteran reported that these symptoms have existed since his return from Vietnam.  The examiner found that the Veteran reflected difficulties with anxious arousal, depression, and anger and irritability and that the Veteran describes mild symptoms of PTSD.  The examiner reasoned that the Veteran has not missed any work due to symptomatology and has been at the same job for 50 years.  The Veteran denies missing work and says work seems to help his symptomatology by keeping him busy.  The examiner found the Veteran fully oriented, with normal psychomotor activity, appropriate speech, and an appropriate affect.  His memory functions were grossly intact and thought processes were goal directed.  Thought content was within normal limits.  There were no suicidal or homicidal ideations.  He was neatly dressed and groomed and no abnormal behavior.  The Veteran's judgment appears to be intact.  And the Veteran's cognitive function is intact.  The examiner assigned a GAF of 61, which represents mild symptoms (e.g., depressed mood and mild insomnia) or some difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., occasional truancy, or theft within the household), but generally functioning pretty well, and has some meaningful interpersonal relationships.  \r\n\r\nIn a November 2008 lay statement, the Veteran's wife stated that she and the Veteran have been married for 38 years.  The Veteran works all of the time because the Veteran said it takes his mind off of Vietnam and all of the things he went through.  The Veteran's wife further stated that the Veteran has been blessed because the man the Veteran works for is like family and understands how the Veteran is.  The Veteran works by himself and does not have to deal with customers.  She further stated that the Veteran cannot be in a crowd of people he gets nervous and he looks like a scared wild animal in a cage.  If the Veteran and the Veteran's wife go to a restaurant they have to go early so there won't be a crowd and the Veteran has to sit by the wall so he can see everybody.  The Veteran also gets in moods where he doesn't want to talk and just wants everybody to leave him alone.  The Veteran's depression will last about a week.  The Veteran's wife further stated that the Veteran also has a problem with loud and sudden noise and people coming up behind him.  The Veteran doesn't want to have friends because he is afraid something will happen to them.  The Veteran's wife believes this is why the Veteran does not have a close relationship with their two children.

E.M.P. has always allowed the Veteran to work independently.  The Veteran has his own space with easy access to the outside.  E.M.P. did not require the Veteran to deal with the public directly.  The Veteran always worked long hours.  In E.M.P.'s opinion, working was the Veteran's therapy.  Due to the Veteran's outstanding work ethic and the Veteran's longtime friendship, E.M.P has made many concessions necessary for the Veteran to continue to work for him. \r\n\r\nIn February 2009 VA treatment record the Veteran's chief complaint is of mild insomnia due in part to trauma-related nightmares.

The medical provider assigned a GAF of 45, which indicates serious symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe obsessional rituals, frequent shoplifting) or any serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., no friends, unable to keep a job).  \r\n\r\nIn a February 2012 VA treatment record the Veteran continued to report the same symptoms from May 2010 VA treatment records.  The medical provider made the same observations from May 2010 VA treatment records and also assigned a GAF of 45, which indicates serious symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe obsessional rituals, frequent shoplifting) or any serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., no friends, unable to keep a job).  \r\n\r\nOn the Veteran's February 2012 substantive appeal the Veteran stated that he has nightmares, he stays from people, night sweats, jumpy to the point the Veteran' hits the ground.

The Veteran stated that he can't even go to church due to the people.  \r\n\r\nIn the June 2012 VA examination report, the Veteran indicated that he quit working in March 2012.  The Veteran stated that he worked at a mechanic shop since 1969.  The Veteran stated that he was able to work and maintain this job because the business owner was like a father to him and allowed him to work by himself and as much or as little as he needed.

The scale score for trauma indicated mild distress as a result of traumatic experiences.

He has a lot of nightmares at night.  Probably about three or four times a week most times.  The Veteran stated that he is prescribed medication to help him sleep.

The Veteran stated that it was embarrassing to say that he can't deal with something when he knows that a lot of people got killed that would glad to be here under any circumstances.  It's just hard to admit it.  The Veteran stated that he didn't tell the prior VA examiner very much of anything.  The Veteran stated that he totally quit work about six or seven months prior to the Travel Board Hearing because he boss was getting on his nerves.  The Veteran worked for his prior employer since he was 16.  The Veteran stated that his prior employment was like a family organization.  It wasn't a big thing where you had to deal with a lot of people.  The Veteran stated that he didn't have to deal with nobody because the employer knew how the Veteran was and made it a point to keep the Veteran to himself.  And the Veteran very seldom had to deal with anybody.  The Veteran stated that he doesn't have any relationships with his family.  The Veteran has a friend that served in Vietnam with the Veteran.  In regards to his prior employment, the Veteran sated that his employer was willing to work with the Veteran even though the Veteran threw tubes through the wall.  The Veteran stated that he has problems with short and long-term memory.  The Veteran stated that he can't remember anything short term.  \r\n\r\nAt the April 2015 Travel Board Hearing, the Veteran's wife stated that the Veteran has a lot of problems with anger and irritability.  She stated that the Veteran could get up in the morning and be okay.  And then the next minute she's around him it's like a totally different person.  It just goes like that.  The Veteran's wife also stated that the Veteran has panic attacks.  He might be fine one minute and the next ho looks like a wild person over there.  The wife also stated that the Veteran has knocked down bedroom doors.  \r\n\r\nOn July 2015 VA treatment records the Veteran reported that his anxiety was worse at this time and he was still having down days but not as bad as before.  From August 2015 to October 2015, January 2016 to November 2016, and February 2017 VA treatment records the Veteran was assigned a GAF score of 45.  In November 2015 VA treatment records the Veteran was assigned a GAF score of 45.  In November 2016 and December 2016 VA treatment record the Veteran was assigned a GAF score of 44. January 2017 VA treatment record the Veteran was assigned a GAF of 43.  These scores indicate serious symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe obsessional rituals, frequent shoplifting) or any serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., no friends, unable to keep a job).  \r\n\r\nIn the January 2017 VA PTSD examination report, the Veteran reported current symptoms of anger, anxiety, depression, feeling lost and worthless, suicidal ideations, and social isolation, chronic sleep impairment.  The examiner found a flattened affect, disturbances of motivation and mood, and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  The examiner also found suicidal ideations without attempt or expressed intent and a history of vague homicidal ideations.  The examiner opined that the Veteran has occupation and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation.  The examiner observed that the Veteran is loud, irritable, and vague but cooperative and mentally intact.  The examiner found that the Veteran's claimed intense anger is not reflected by objective testing in the Minnesota multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI).  \r\n\r\nIn a February 2017 letter, the Veteran's VA treating psychologist stated that he has been working with the Veteran since March 2015.  The VA psychologist stated that the Veteran's symptoms profile seems much more debilitating that the percentage rating indicates.  The VA psychologist noted the Veteran's reported symptoms as re-experiencing (intrusive thoughts, nightmares, intense psychological reactivity and psychological stress when exposed to triggers), avoidance, and increased arousal.  The VA psychologist found that the Veteran's symptoms combined with his documented depressive symptoms have severely impaired the Veteran's functioning across multiple life domains.  The Veteran will require consistent outpatient follow-up to address his symptoms.  The Veteran should be encouraged to live an active lifestyle, but additional undue stress would likely only exacerbate his already significant symptoms.  The VA psychologist noted that employment would probably not be in the Veteran's best interests or the interests of those his limited functioning may negatively impact.  \r\n\r\nIn a February 2017 letter, the Veteran VA treating nurse practitioner stated that she has been treating the Veteran since 2009.  The treating nurse practitioner noted that the Veteran stated he was allowed to work by himself but this business (mechanic shop) has since closed and he no longer works.  The Veteran stated that he is not comfortable being around people and he is very jumpy.  The Veteran reported that the prescribed medication seems to take the edge off.  The Veteran reported that his sleep is fragmented and he has frequent combat nightmares.  The Veteran stated that he does not feel he is able to work.  The Veteran is enrolled in intensive psychotherapy that the Veteran stated has helped but he remains very symptomatic.   \r\n\r\nThe foregoing evidence demonstrates that for the entire period on appeal, and resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, his PTSD has warranted a 70 percent evaluation.  The Veteran has demonstrated deficiencies in mood, family relations, and work.  Although he maintained job until 2012, this was mainly due to his longstanding relationship with his employer.  Likewise, he has remained married, but this is due in large part to his wife merely putting up with his anger and other symptoms.  Furthermore, he has expressed suicidal ideations and impaired impulse control.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2017 VA examinations were adequate based on the symptoms as reported by the Veteran at those times, the Board affords greater weight to the lay statements from the Veteran, the Veteran's wife, D.D., C.H, J.B.S, E.M.P, L.Y., the VA treatment records, and letter from the Veteran's VA treating psychologist.  This is because as the Veteran noted at t the Board hearing, he tended to underreport his symptoms to VA examiners with whom he was unfamiliar.  VA treatment records note that the Veteran's GAF score was between 40 and 50, indicative of serious symptoms; or serious impairment in social, occupation, or school functioning, from October 2009 through the period on appeal.  Also the Veteran's VA treating psychologist believed the Veteran's symptoms indicated a higher rating than assigned.  And the VA treatment records and the letter by the VA treating psychologist were supported by all of the lay statements.  \r\n\r\nThe evidence does not show that entitlement to an evaluation higher than 70 percent is warranted.  A 100 percent evaluation, however, is not for assignment.  First, there is not total social impairment as the Veteran retains at least one friend and has remained married.  The Veteran was consistently able to perform the activities of daily living and maintained good hygiene at all times.  The Veteran was fully oriented and had no gross impairment in thought processes or speech.  The Veteran denied hallucinations and delusions and did not have memory loss for names of close relatives or his own name.  The VA treatment records, VA examinations, the Veteran, and the Veteran's wife do state that the Veteran does have anger, but that anger does not amount to persistent danger of hurting others.  Moreover, at no point did the Veteran's symptoms approach the severity and frequency necessary to cause total social and occupational impairment.  Thus, the criteria for an evaluation higher than 70 percent for PTSD are not met.  \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, and resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that the Veteran's PTSD has more nearly approximated the 70 percent criteria for the entire appeal period, which begins on October 3, 2008.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 4.3, 4.130, DC 9411 (2016); see Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. 436.  \r\n\r\nNeither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. Ap. 366,  369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nA 70 percent, but no higher, evaluation for PTSD for the entire period on appeal is granted.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran asserts that his service-connected PTSD renders him unemployable.  A TDIU may be assigned when a Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that: if the veteran has only one such disability, the disability must be rated at 60 percent or more, or, if the veteran has two or more disabilities, at least one disability is rated at 40 percent or more and additional disabilities bring the veteran's combined disability rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a) (2017).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran meets the schedular criteria.  Beginning October 3, 2008, there are two service-connected disabilities.  The Veteran's prostate cancer was rated 100 percent and reduced to 40 percent on December 1, 2009.  The Veteran's PTSD is now evaluated at 70 percent from October 3, 2008.  Effective March 21, 2009, the Veteran was service connected at noncompensable for erectile dysfunction.  Effective April 6, 2009, service connection was granted for bilateral testicular atrophy, which was assigned a 20 percent evaluation, and then reduced to noncompensable in December 2009.  Effective May 3, 2012, service connection was granted for tinnitus at 10 percent and hearing loss at noncompensable.  From October 3, 2008 the Veteran's combined evaluation is at least 70 percent.  Thus, the Veteran meets schedular requirements for a TDIU, and the only remaining issue is whether the Veteran is able to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran reported that he has an eighth or ninth grade education.  The Veteran worked as a mechanic.  The Veteran stated that upon his discharge from service he worked a few jobs but was fired for unknown reasons.  The Veteran stated that he began working as a mechanic with a family friend and had worked there for 40 years.  The Veteran stated that his employer allowed him to work in isolation.  In March 2012 the Veteran stated that he had to leave employment due to him being angry and throwing tubes through the wall.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's employer stated in a letter that the Veteran was unable to maintain employment upon his discharge from service.  Because the Veteran was a family friend, the employer hired him and made accommodations for the Veteran's social anxiety.  The employer stated that but for his accommodations, the Veteran would not be able to maintain employment.  \r\n\r\nIn a February 2017 letter, the Veteran's VA treating psychologist stated that the Veteran should be encouraged to live an active lifestyle, but additional undue stress would likely only exacerbate his already significant symptoms.  The VA psychologist noted that employment would probably not be in the Veteran's best interests or the interests of those his limited functioning may negatively impact.  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that these opinions are not significantly probative and thus adequate upon which to base a grant of TDIU.  The Veteran's employer opinion is not competent as he is not qualified to make such determinations.  Additionally, the Veteran's treating psychologist merely noted that employment would exacerbate his PTSD, not that he was unable to work.  Thus, on remand, additional information regarding the Veteran's service-connected disabilities is warranted. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1. Provide the Veteran a VA social and industrial survey by a VA social worker or other appropriate personnel.  The examiner should elicit and set forth pertinent facts regarding the Veteran's medical history, education and employment history, day-to-day functioning, and social and industrial capacity. The ultimate purpose of the VA social and industrial survey is to ascertain the impact of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities (his PTSD, prostate cancer residuals, erectile dysfunction, bilateral testicular atrophy, tinnitus, and hearing loss) on his ability to work.  The examiner should not consider the Veteran's age and any nonservice-connected disorders.  The examiner is not limited to the foregoing instructions, and may seek initial or additional development in any survey area that would shed more light on the Veteran's ability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation.  \r\n\r\n2.  Notify the Veteran that it is his responsibility to report for any scheduled examination and to cooperate in the development of the claim, and that the consequences for failure to report for a VA examination without good cause may include denial of the claim.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 3.158, 3.655 (2017).  In the event that the Veteran does not report for any scheduled examination, documentation must be obtained which shows that notice scheduling the examination was sent to the last known address.  It must also be indicated whether any notice that was sent was returned as undeliverable.\r\n\r\n3.  Ensure compliance with the directives of this remand.  If the report is deficient in any manner, the AOJ must implement corrective procedures.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998).  \r\n\r\n4.  After completing the above action, and any other development as may be indicated by any response received as a consequence of the actions taken in the paragraphs above, the claim must be readjudicated.  If the claim remains denied, a supplemental statement of the case must be provided to the Veteran and his representative.  After the Veteran and his representative have had an adequate opportunity to respond, the appeal must be returned to the Board for appellate review.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 5109B, 7112 (West 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________\r\nK.
