post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nVeteran represented by:\tVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States\r\n\r\n\r\nWITNESSES AT HEARING ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nVeteran and Spouse\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nI. Umo, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served active duty in the U.S. Army from July 1968 to July 1970.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2014 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Detroit, Michigan.  The rating decision denied the Veteran's claim for PTSD and he filed his notice of disagreement in March 2014.  The Veteran timely filed his substantive appeal in June 2014.\r\n\r\nOn July 18, 2017, the Veteran testified at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ), via videoconference.  A transcript of the hearing is of record.\r\n\r\nThe Board advises the Veteran to submit an increased rating claim for his service-connected generalized anxiety disorder.  In the July 18, 2017 hearing, the Veteran claimed that his psychiatric condition was worse than the 30 percent rating assigned.  Prior to March 24, 2015, his statements would have been enough for the Board to infer an increased rating claim.  However, after March 24, 2015, an increased rating claim must be filed on the formal claim form, VA Form 526.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is not currently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder have not been met.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1110, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2017).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  VA's Duty to Notify & Assist\r\n\r\nVA has a duty to notify and a duty to assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A and 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2017); see also Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183, 187 (2002).\r\n\r\nThe duty to notify has been met.  See the July 2011 VCAA letter.  Neither the Veteran, nor his representative, has alleged prejudice with regard to notice.  The Federal Court of Appeals has held that \"absent extraordinary circumstances ... it is appropriate for the Board and the Veterans Court to address only those procedural arguments specifically raised by the veteran ....\"  Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015).  In light of the foregoing, nothing more is required.\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), codified in pertinent part at 38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 5103, 5103A (2012), and the pertinent implementing regulation, codified at 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.159 (2017), provide that VA will assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate a claim but is not required to provide assistance to a claimant if there is no reasonable possibility that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.  \r\n\r\nThe record reflects that all available records pertinent to the claim have been obtained.  The Veteran has not identified any outstanding evidence that could be obtained to substantiate the claim; the Board is also unaware of any such evidence.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Board will address the merits of the claims.\r\n\r\nService Connection Claims\r\n\r\nThe Veteran asserts that he developed PTSD due to his active duty service.\r\n\r\nService connection is granted for disability resulting from disease or injury that was incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1110, 1131 (2012);        38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.303(a) (2017).  Additionally, service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.                 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a73.303(d).\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection benefits is established when the following elements are satisfied: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service (the medical \"nexus\" requirement).  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.303(a) (2017).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the disorder in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nThe evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a recognizable stressor during service to support a diagnosis of PTSD will vary depending upon whether a veteran engaged in \"combat with the enemy.\"  Gaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353 (1998).  If VA determines that a veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and his alleged stressor is combat-related, then his lay testimony or statement is accepted as conclusive evidence of the stressor's occurrence and no further development or corroborative evidence is required, provided that such testimony is found to be \"satisfactory,\" i.e., credible and \"consistent with circumstances, disorders or hardships of service.\"  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.304(f)(1); see also Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91 (1993). \r\n\r\nWhere the veteran's alleged stressor was not combat related, then a veteran's lay testimony, alone, would not be sufficient to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor; rather, corroborating evidence would be needed to support the claim for service connection.  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997); Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389 (1996).  See also Zarycki, 6 Vet. App. at 98; Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 289 (1994).\r\n\r\nIn July 2010, VA published a final rule that amended its adjudication regulations governing service connection for PTSD by relaxing, in certain circumstances, the evidentiary standard for establishing the required in-service stressor.  75 Fed. Reg. 39843 (July 13, 2010) as amended by 75 Fed. Reg. 41092 (July 15, 2010) (providing the correct effective date of July 13, 2010, for the revised 38 C.F.R. \r\n\u00c2\u00a7 3.304(f)).  Specifically, the final rule amends 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.304(f) by re-designating current paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(4) as paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(5), respectively, and by adding a new paragraph (f)(3) that reads as follows: \r\n\r\n(f)(3) If a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of [PTSD] and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  For purposes of this paragraph, \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the Veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the Veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.  Id.  \r\n\r\nThe revised \u00c2\u00a7 3.304(f) generally applies to claims of service connection for PTSD appealed to the Board on or after July 13, 2010.  In this case, the claim for PTSD was appealed to the Board in June 2014, and therefore the revised regulation would be applicable.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Circuit has limited the applicability of the revised \u00c2\u00a7 3.304(f) to appeals where \"a claimed in-service PTSD stressor relates to an event or circumstance that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with and that was perpetrated by a member of an enemy military or by a terrorist.\"  Hall v. Shinseki, 717 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2013); see also Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286 (2012) (\"[T]he examples provided [in subsection (f)(3)] all involve actions originating from individuals who commit hostile military or terrorist acts toward the U.S. military, not nefarious, or even criminal, acts of one service member directed at another service\r\n\r\nIn making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record.  A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).\r\nLay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\r\n\r\nWhen considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau at 1376-77.\r\n\r\nThe Board must assess the credibility and weight of evidence.  Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1046 (1998); Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001).  The Federal Circuit recognizes that the Board has an inherent fact-finding ability.  Jefferson v. Principi, 271 F.3d 1072, 1076 (Fed. Cir. 2001); see also 38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 7104(a).  As a finder of fact, when considering whether lay evidence is satisfactory, the Board may also properly consider internal inconsistency of the statements, facial plausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the Veteran, and the Veteran's demeanor when testifying at a hearing.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 38 (2007); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).\r\n\r\nThe standard of proof to be applied in decisions on claims for Veterans' benefits is set forth at 38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 5107 (2012).  A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.102.  When a claimant seeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the claimant prevails.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  The preponderance of the evidence must be against the claim for benefits to be denied.  See Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518 (1996).\r\n\r\nHere, the initial question for the Board is whether the Veteran has current diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that competent, credible, and probative evidence establishes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nA September 2013 private medical record reveals the Veteran was evaluated for his psychiatric condition.  In that record, the examiner Dr. M.B., diagnosed the Veteran with dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and impulse-control disorder not otherwise specified.  The Veteran reported with complaints of anxiety, depression, irritability, bad mood, temper tantrums, fits of rage, and low tolerance for stress and frustration.  The Veteran claimed he had PTSD.  The examiner, however, indicated the Veteran had PTSD symptoms, but did not diagnose him with PTSD.  The examiner's treatment included reducing anxiety, depression, and emotional psychological issues, and to rule out PTSD symptoms from the Veteran's war experiences.  In further treatment records from January 2014, the examiner indicated that the Veteran had PTSD symptoms that were chronic, but maintained the prior diagnoses of dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and impulse-control disorder not otherwise specified.  PTSD symptoms are not the same thing as a PTSD diagnosis.  This evidence does not document the presence of a PTSD diagnosis.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in February 2014 to evaluate his psychiatric condition.  At that time, the examiner indicated that the Veteran's symptoms did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under DSM-5.  Specifically, the examiner summarized that the Veteran has some features of the disorder, but does not meet the full criteria for PTSD.  Historically and currently he has not experienced persistent recurrent symptoms of PTSD.  He, has however, experienced mild anxiety since service.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with generalized anxiety disorder.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's claimed condition of PTSD was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service stressor, because the Veteran did not meet the criteria for PTSD.  Likewise, in a May 2014 C&P medical opinion, the examiner stated that the Veteran does not meet the criteria for PTSD, but did develop generalized anxiety symptoms due to his active duty service.  \r\n\r\nThere is no statement from any health care professional produced during the appeal period which includes a valid diagnosis of PTSD which is attributed to the Veteran's active duty service.  \r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay testimony that he suffers from PTSD, but the Veteran does not have the requisite medical training or experience to diagnose a psychiatric condition, therefore his statements are not competent with regard to what diagnosis to assign to his mental health symptoms.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, the Board finds that the most competent, credible, and probative evidence of record does not show that the Veteran currently or at any point during the appeal period has a valid diagnosis of PTSD based on competent medical evidence.  Additionally, the Board notes that the Veteran is already service-connected for anxiety disorder therefore an acquired psychiatric disorder has been determined.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing reasons, the claim for service connection for PTSD must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nG.
