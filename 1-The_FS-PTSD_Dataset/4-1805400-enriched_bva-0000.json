The statements were signed. \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1. The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal of service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to service-connected PTSD with major depressive disorder, have been met. 38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 20.204 (2017).\r\n2. The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 20.204 (2017).\r\n\r\n3. The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal of the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for service-connected PTSD with major depression for the period prior to May 24, 2012 have been met. 38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 20.204 (2017).\r\n\r\n4. The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal of the issue of an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine for the period from October 14, 2014 have been met. 38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 20.204 (2017).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThe Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 20.204. Withdrawal may be made by a veteran or by his or her authorized representative. Id. \r\n\r\nIn an email communication dated in March 2017, the Veteran indicated he wished to withdraw his pending issues on appeal, after being informed by his representative organization that he was rated at a 100 percent combined disability rating with special monthly compensation. \r\n\r\nTo confirm the Veteran's intention of withdrawing his appeal, the Veteran's representative submitted a memorandum in January 2018 stating, \"we are submitting [the Veteran's] request to withdraw his pending appeal at the BVA.\" Attached with the memorandum is a signed statement by the Veteran, who stated he would like to withdraw the pending appeal because he is satisfied with his combined disability rating.\r\n\r\nThere thus remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration as to the issues identified on the title page, above. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review these claims, and they are dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal for entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to service-connected PTSD with major depressive disorder, is dismissed.\r\n\r\nThe appeal for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.\r\n\r\nThe appeal for entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for PTSD with major depressive disorder, for the period prior to May 24, 2012 is dismissed.\r\n\r\nThe appeal for entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine for the period from October 14, 2014 is dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nCAROLINE B.
