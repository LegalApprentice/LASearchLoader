psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nVeteran represented by:\tFlorida Department of Veterans Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nR. Kettler, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from April 1973 to April 1976.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2011 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\nThis issue was previously before the Board in July 2017, at which time it was remanded for further development.\r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) and Virtual VA paperless claims processing systems.\r\n\r\nThis appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 20.900(c) (2017).  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 7107(a)(2) (2012).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe competent and probative evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's PTSD had its onset in or is otherwise related to his period of active service.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1110, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2017).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI. Duties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nAs the issue decided herein is being granted in full, any deficiency as to VA's duties to notify and assist would be harmless error and will not be discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Legal Analysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  See 38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.303(a).  To substantiate a claim of service connection, there must be evidence of (1) a current disability (for which service connection is sought); (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a causal connection between the disease or injury in service and the current disability.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\r\n\r\nTo establish entitlement to service connection for PTSD, there must be: (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.125(a), which requires it be diagnosed in accordance with the DSM; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and, (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a73.304(f).  \r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. \u00c2\u00a75107(b).\r\n\r\nIII. Merits of the Claim\r\n\r\nThe Veteran asserts that he has PTSD is due to stressors experienced during his period of military service.  After a careful review of the record, the Board finds that the evidence supports the Veteran's claim.  \r\n\r\nInitially, the Board finds that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a psychiatric disability during the appeal period.  A November 2016 Lake City VAMC treatment record demonstrates a diagnosis of PTSD, recurrent depression, and psychosis.  February 2017 Gainesville VAMC treatment records indicate the Veteran was undergoing electroconvulsive therapy for his mental disorders.\r\n\r\nRegarding a stressor, the Veteran has consistently reported he sold a gun to a fellow soldier who used it to commit suicide.  The Veteran reported discovering the body.  See February 2012 Lake City VAMC treatment record.  In November 2010, the Veteran presented to Gainesville VAMC for mental health treatment.  The attending psychologist indicated, \"there is no doubt that patient has PTSD from the experience in the military and that subsequent events have caused resurgences in symptoms over the years.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, the Board finds the evidence shows a nexus between the Veteran's current diagnosis of PTSD is related to his in-service stressors.\r\n\r\nIn a February 2011 letter, Dr. E.B., a clinical psychologist, stated that the Veteran had PTSD that was directly related to his reported military trauma.  Dr. E.B.'s letter reflects that the Veteran's PTSD was due in significant part to his in-service traumas.  She further noted that he continued to experience PTSD symptomatology throughout his life after separation from service.  \r\n\r\nIn contrast, the March 2017 and August 2017 VA examiner found the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of PTSD or another psychiatric disorder that conformed to the DSM.  In March 2017, the examiner was unable to determine if the Veteran currently meets the DSM-V criteria for PTSD or another mental disorder because the Veteran was uncooperative with the examination and test results indicated a feigning of symptoms.  The examiner concluded by stating that the fact that although the Veteran was not diagnosed with a mental disorder, this was not tantamount to saying that the he did not have a mental disorder.  Rather it reflected that because he was uncooperative the examiner was unable to differentiate possible legitimate symptoms from feigned symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn an addendum opinion in August 2017, the examiner refused to comment on the records of inpatient and outpatient care in the claims file.  The examiner justified his refusal by concluding that treatment providers typically accept their patient's statements at face value, whereas the examiner performed a forensic test.\r\n\r\nWith consideration of the above, the Board affords great weight to the Dr. E.B. letter and the various VA outpatient mental health records discussed above finding the Veteran met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis based on his reported stressors stemming from his military service.  The Board finds it significant that various VA psychiatrists at two different facilities - who independently evaluated the Veteran for PTSD and accounted for his reported stressor - individually made these favorable diagnoses and medical findings.\r\n\r\nMoreover, with regard to the VA examiner's charge in the August 2017 report, the Board notes that health professionals \"are presumed to know the DSM requirements applicable to their practice and to have taken them into account in providing a PTSD diagnosis.\"  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 139, 140 (1997).  For this reason, diagnoses provided by the treating providers should not be disregarded.\r\n\r\nUpon review of the foregoing, the evidence is at least in equipoise.  Thus, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is for application, and resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 51-7(b); 38 C.F.R. 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nCynthia M.
