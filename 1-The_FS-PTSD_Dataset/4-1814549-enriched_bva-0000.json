for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nVeteran represented by:\tNorth Carolina Division of Veterans Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nThe Veteran\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nB. Cannon, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 2000 to December 2005.    \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2012 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Columbia, South Carolina.  Jurisdiction has since transferred to the RO in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  \r\n\r\nIn January 2018, a video hearing was held before the undersigned.  A transcript of that hearing is of record.\r\n\r\nThe Board has re-characterized the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to a claim of entitlement to an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include anxiety, PTSD, and depression.  This is based on diagnoses provided by two examiners.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 6 (2009) (holding that when a claimant makes a claim, the claimant is seeking service connection for symptoms regardless of how those symptoms are diagnosed or labeled).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe evidence supports a nexus between an in-service event and the Veteran's current diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression, have been met.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1110, 1131, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.303 (2017).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nService connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nMost importantly, two medical opinions support the existence of a current psychiatric disability that is linked to service.  A November 2011 VA medical opinion states that the Veteran's in-service stressors \"are judged to be the primary source of [her] current anxiety disorder.\"  Similarly, a January 2018 private medical opinion states that the Veteran has PTSD and depressive disorder and that these disorders are at least as likely as not related to service.  Moreover, there is no dispute that the Veteran served as a supply sergeant in Iraq, and neither examiner disputes that the Veteran was exposed to enemy fire while in service.  Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression, is granted.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMichael J. Skaltsounis \r\nVeterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
