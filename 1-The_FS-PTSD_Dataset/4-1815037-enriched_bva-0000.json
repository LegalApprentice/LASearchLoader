Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\r\n\r\n2. Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU).\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAppellant represented by:\tBarbara B. Harris, Attorney at Law\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nM. Thomas, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, served on active duty from May 1970 to January 1972.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2010 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Roanoke, Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn January 2012, during the pendency of this appeal, the RO increased the rating for PTSD from 30 percent to 50 percent, for the entire period on appeal.  Because less than the maximum available benefit for a schedular rating was awarded and because the increases were not awarded for the entirety of the claim period, the claims remain before the Board.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999); AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993).\r\n\r\nThis matter was remanded by the Board in August 2016 for further development. \r\n\r\nIn a November 2017 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for sleep apnea.  Such award represents a complete grant of the benefits sought and as such, the sleep apnea claim is no longer on appeal. \r\n\r\nThe issue of entitlement to a TDIU has been raised by the record and has been added to the appeal.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453, 54 (2009) (holding that a request for a TDIU, whether expressly raised by a veteran or reasonably raised by the record, is not a separate \"claim\" for benefits, but rather, can be part of a claim for increased compensation); see also Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (holding that a separate, formal claim is not required in cases where an informal claim for TDIU has been reasonably raised).\r\n\r\nBelow, the Board assigns a 70 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD. The issue of entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent and the derivative TDIU issue are addressed in the REMAND portion of the decision below and are REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). \r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nFor the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's PTSD symptoms most nearly approximate occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family, relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nFor the entire period on appeal, the criteria for an initial rating of 70 percent for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1155, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \r\n\u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411 (2017).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nProcedural Duties\r\n\r\nIn this case, neither the Veteran nor his attorney has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that \"the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board . . . to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board.\"); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).\r\n\r\nIncreased Initial Ratings - Laws and Regulations\r\n\r\nDisability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity and individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1155 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.1 (2017). \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations.  See generally 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.1 (2017); Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995).  Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  Staged ratings are appropriate for any initial rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).\r\n\r\nWhere there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. \r\n\u00c2\u00a7 4.7 (2017).  Any reasonable doubt regarding a degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.3 (2017). \r\n\r\nIn rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material favorable to the claimant.  Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).  Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted.  Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). \r\n\r\nWhen considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  A veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to her through her senses.  See Layno, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469.  Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, where the determination is not medical in nature and is capable of lay observation.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  Lay evidence may establish a diagnosis of a simple medical condition, a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or symptoms that later support a diagnosis by a medical professional.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377. \r\n\r\nWhen all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 5107(b) (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.102 (2017).\r\n\r\nIncreased Initial Rating Claim for PTSD - Analysis\r\n\r\nThe RO has assigned an initial 50 percent disability rating for the Veteran's PTSD under 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.130, DC 9411 (2017).   The Veteran seeks a higher rating.  \r\n\r\nAll psychiatric disabilities are evaluated under a general rating formula for mental disorders.  Under such formula, a 50 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short-and long-term memory (e.g. retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing effective work and social relationships.\r\n\r\nA 70 percent rating is warranted when the psychiatric disorder results in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas such as work, school, family relations, judgment, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such an unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.\r\n\r\nA total schedular rating of 100 percent is warranted when the disorder results in total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of mental and personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.\r\n\r\nIn applying the above criteria, the Board notes that, when it is not possible to separate the effects of the service-connected disability from a nonservice-connected disability, such signs and symptoms shall be attributed to the service-connected disability.  See 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.102 (2017); Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181 (1998) citing Mitchem v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 136, 140 (1996) (the Board is precluded from differentiating between symptomatology attributed to a nonservice-connected disability and a service-connected disability in the absence of medical evidence which does so).\r\n\r\nEffective August 4, 2014, VA amended the portion of the Rating Schedule dealing with mental disorders and its adjudication regulations that define the term \"psychosis\" to remove outdated references to the DSM-IV and replace them with references to the updated Fifth Edition (DSM-5).  See 79 Fed. Reg. 149, 45094.  The provisions of the interim final rule apply to all applications for benefits that are received by VA or that were pending before the Agency of Original Jurisdiction on or after August 4, 2014.  Id.  VA adopted as final, without change, the interim final rule and clarified that the provisions of this interim final rule do not apply to claims that have been certified for appeal to the Board or are pending before the Board as of August 4, 2014.  See 80 Fed. Reg. 53, 14308 (March 19, 2015).  The RO certified the Veteran's appeal to the Board in March 2016; therefore, the claim is governed by DSM 5.  Thus, GAF scores are not relevant for consideration in this appeal.  See Golden v. Shulkin, No. 161208, 2018 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 202, *9 (Vet. App. Feb. 23, 2018) (holding that the Board errs when it uses GAF scores to assign a psychiatric rating in cases where DSM-5 applies). \r\n\r\nWhen evaluating mental health disorders, the factors listed in the Rating Schedule are simply examples of the type and degree of symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating; the analysis should not be limited solely to whether a veteran exhibited the symptoms listed in the Rating Schedule.  Rather, the determination should be based on all of a veteran's symptoms affecting his level of occupational and social impairment.  See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442-43 (2002).  The lists of symptoms under the Rating Schedule are meant to be examples of symptoms that would warrant the disability evaluation, but are not meant to be exhaustive.  Id. \r\n\r\nAfter a review of the evidence, both lay and medical, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms have most nearly approximated occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas for the entire period on appeal.  The evidence has consistently reflected that the Veteran hears mumbling voices that he cannot make out, or his name called.  See August 2009, March 2011, November 2011, and June 2012 VA treatment notes.  A November 2016 private evaluation report indicated that the Veteran denied having suicidal ideation and delusions.  However, the Veteran reported seeing figures that he described as \"unclear faces that just look at me.\"  He stated that he also hears mumbling voices, but \"nothing concrete.\"  The Veteran also reported having impaired impulse control, including a heightened startle response, and being easily irritated.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, an August 2009 VA treatment note indicated that the Veteran reported having suicidal thoughts during service, but denied current suicidal ideations.  In November 2011, the Veteran reported thinking about not waking up sometimes and what this would be like, but denied any intent or planning to be dead or hurt himself.  See November 2011 VA treatment note.  A March 2011 VA treatment note indicated that the Veteran was working three days each week and had significant sleep impairment.  A June 2015 VA treatment note indicated that he was working one day a week and was a chaplain at prisons and in bank ministry.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, the evidence indicates that throughout the period on appeal the Veteran has had symptoms of frequent panic attacks, hypervigilance, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, impaired impulse control, suicidal ideation, and persistent delusions and/or hallucinations.  For these reasons, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms more nearly approximated occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas throughout the initial rating period on appeal. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms more nearly approximate the criteria under DC 9411 for a rating of 70 percent for the entire initial rating period on appeal.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 5107; 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.102, 4.3, 4.7, 4.130.\r\n\r\nFinally, neither the Veteran nor his attorney has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 69-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nFor the entire period on appeal, an initial rating of 70 percent for PTSD is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing payment of monetary benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nAs decided above, the Board assigns a 70 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD. Notably, the criteria for a higher schedular rating for PTSD involves determining the level of occupational impairment, and the issue of entitlement to a TDIU also addresses employability issues and further evidence is needed prior to analyzing these claims. \r\n\r\nAs such, on remand, the Veteran should be provided the necessary notice letter and forms necessary to substantiate a TDIU claim.  He should also be provided with an updated examination to assess the current nature and severity of his service-connected psychiatric disorder, including any effect it has on his unemployability, if applicable.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Send the Veteran a VCAA notice letter informing him of what is needed to substantiate entitlement to TDIU and of the allocation of responsibilities between the Veteran and VA for obtaining relevant evidence on his behalf.\r\n\r\n2. Perform any additional development with respect to the claim for a TDIU, to include obtaining from the Veteran a detailed statement regarding his educational attainment, post-service work history, and additional training (VA Form 21-8940). All actions to obtain the requested statement should be documented fully in the claims file.\r\n\r\n3. After completing the above, and any other development as may be indicated by any response received as a consequence of the actions taken in the preceding paragraphs, the Veteran's claim for a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD and the derivative TDIU claim should be readjudicated based on the entirety of the evidence.  If the claims remain denied, the Veteran and his representative should be issued a supplemental statement of the case.  An appropriate period of time should be allowed for response.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 5109B, 7112 (2012).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nS. B.
