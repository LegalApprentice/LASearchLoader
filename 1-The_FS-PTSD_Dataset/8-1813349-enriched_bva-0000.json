the\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Montgomery, Alabama\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUES\r\n\r\n1.  Whether new and material evidence has been submitted to reopen the claim of entitlement to service connection for a skin disorder, characterized as tinea versicolor.\r\n\r\n2.  Whether new and material evidence has been submitted to reopen the claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, characterized as posttraumatic-stress disorder (PTSD).  \r\n\r\n3.  Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, characterized as PTSD and adjustment reaction, and not to include a neurocognitive disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nJ. Meyer, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from October 1956 to November 1957, and from September 1990 to May 1991.\r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from October 2009 and December 2011 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama.  \r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges that the Veteran is claiming entitlement to service connection for PTSD and an adjustment disorder.  During the course of this appeal, his psychiatric symptoms have also been diagnosed as depression and anxiety.  However, a service connection claim which describes only one particular psychiatric disorder should not necessarily be limited to that disorder.  Rather, as reflected in the title page, VA should consider the claim as one for any psychiatric disability that may reasonably be encompassed by evidence of record.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the claims file contains two separate VA Form 21-22 appointing both Disabled American Veterans and the American Legion as the Veteran's designated representative.  However, as the Veteran may only have one designated representative, the Veteran was sent a letter in December 2017 requesting that he clarify/select his appointed representative.  The Veteran was notified that if he did not respond within 30 days, the Board will assume that he wishes to proceed without representation.  Therefore, given that 30 days has passed without a response, the Board finds that the Veteran has declined representation and wants to proceed with the appeal pro se.  \r\n\r\nThis appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 20.900(c) (2017).  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 7107(a)(2) (2012).\r\n\r\nThe issue of whether new and material evidence has been submitted to reopen the claim of entitlement to service connection for a skin disorder, characterized as tinea versicolor, is addressed in the REMAND portion of the decision below and is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  In a January 2007 rating decision, the claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, characterized as PTSD was denied because it was not caused by or related to service.  \r\n\r\n2.  The evidence added to the record since the January 2007 rating decision relates to an unestablished fact that is necessary to substantiate the claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.\r\n\r\n3.  The Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, not including a neurocognitive disorder.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1.  The January 2007 rating decision that denied the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, characterized as PTSD, is final.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 20.1103 (2017).\r\n\r\n2.  As the evidence received subsequent to the January 2007 rating decision is new and material, the requirements to reopen the claim for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, characterized as PTSD, have been met.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 5108, 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.102, 3.156 (2017).\r\n\r\n3.  The criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, characterized as PTSD and adjustment reaction, and not to include a neurocognitive disorder, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1110, 1131, 5103(a), 5103A (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 3.159, 3.303, 3.304 (2017).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nNew and Material Evidence\r\n\r\nIn order for evidence to be sufficient to reopen a previously disallowed claim, it must be both new and material.  If the evidence is new, but not material, the inquiry ends and the claim cannot be reopened.  See Smith v. West, 12 Vet. App. 312, 314 (1999); Manio v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 140 (1991).\r\n\r\nUnder the relevant regulation, \"new\" evidence is defined as evidence not previously submitted to agency decision-makers.  \"Material\" evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim.  If it finds that the submitted evidence is new and material, VA may then proceed to evaluate the merits of the claim on the basis of all evidence of record, but only after ensuring that the duty to assist the veteran in developing the facts necessary for the claim has been satisfied.  See Elkins v. West, 12 Vet. App. 209 (1999).\r\n\r\nThe threshold for determining whether new and material evidence raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating a claim is low, and consideration is not limited to whether the newly submitted evidence relates specifically to the reason the claim was last denied.  Rather, consideration should include whether the evidence could reasonably substantiate the claim were the claim to be reopened, either by triggering the Secretary's duty to assist or through consideration of an alternative theory of entitlement.  See Shade v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 110, 117-18 (2010). \r\n\r\nIn this case the Veteran is claiming entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  The Veteran's claim has been previously denied by the RO in January 2007 on the basis that his psychiatric disorder, characterized as PTSD, was not incurred in or related to service.  He did not appeal that decision, nor did he submit any new and material evidence within a year of receiving it.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242 (2011).  This represents the last final denial of the claim.\r\n\r\nAfter a review of the evidence submitted since the January 2007 rating decision became final, the Board determines that the claim should be reopened.  The evidence now includes new medical evidence, including a VA examination, which raises the possibility that his psychiatric disorder is related to his active duty service.  Not only is this evidence \"new\" in that it was not of record prior to the last final denial of the claim, it is also \"material,\" as it relates to an unestablished fact necessary to support the claim.  Namely, it shows that there may be a nexus between the Veteran's psychiatric disorder and his active duty service.  Therefore, the claim should be reopened on this basis.\r\n\r\nService Connection\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is claiming entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder which he asserts is related to active service.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, under the relevant laws and regulations, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1110, 1131 (2012).  Generally, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 505 (1995).\r\n\r\nCertain chronic diseases, including certain psychoses, are subject to presumptive service connection if manifest to a compensable degree within one year from separation from service even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).  Moreover, for such chronic diseases, an alternative method of establishing the second and third Shedden/Caluza element is through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology if the disability claimed qualifies as a chronic disease listed in 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.309(a).  See 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2014).\r\n\r\nService connection may only be granted for a current disability; when a claimed condition is not shown, there may be no grant of service connection.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1110 (2012); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141 (1992) (Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability).  \"In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim.\"  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).\r\n\r\nUpon review of all evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's service connection claim should be denied.  \r\n\r\nAs a preliminary matter, the Board determines that aside from his service-connected neurocognitive disorder, the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder at any point during the period on appeal.  Specifically, in order to clarify whether the nature of the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms are attributable to a separate disorder other than a neurocognitive disorder, the Veteran underwent VA psychiatric examinations in February 2011 and October 2015.  After a thorough psychiatric evaluation, the examiners determined that a diagnosis for any other psychiatric disorder was not warranted.  In support, the examiners specifically noted that while the Veteran \"was certainly exposed to an array of potentially traumatic stressors during service,\" he did not have \"PTSD or other psychiatric disorders.\"  Moreover, psychological testing did not suggest that a psychiatric diagnosis was warranted.  Thus, while the presence of some psychiatric symptoms were reported, these symptoms alone without an underlying diagnosis, is not a service connectable disability.  Sanchez-Benitez v. West, 13 Vet. App. 282, 285 (1999); Sanchez-Benitez v. Principi, 259 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2001). \r\n\r\nIn arriving at this conclusion, the Board acknowledges that various psychiatric disorders such as PTSD, depression, anxiety, and an adjustment reaction, have been previously diagnosed by the Veteran's treating medical providers.  However, greater probative value is placed on the conclusions of the VA examiners' determination that a diagnosis for these disorders is not warranted.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has recognized the unique probative value of opinions provided by VA psychiatric examiners in the context of VA examinations for a number of reasons, to include the special training VA practitioners receive in conducting such examinations, the amount of quality review these examination reports receive, the ability to review the claims file, and VA programs to ensure consistency.  See Nat'l Org. of Veterans' Advocates, Inc. v. Sec. Of Veterans Affairs, 669 F.3d 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing 75 Fed. Reg. 39,843, 39,847-48 (July 13, 2010)).  \r\n\r\nMoreover, and while not outcome determinative, the Board notes that the rating criteria for the Veteran's neurocognitive disorder (Diagnostic Code 9310) and the rating criteria for PTSD, anxiety disorder, depression, and an adjustment disorder are identical under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  See 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.130 (2017).  The Federal Circuit has held that two defined diagnoses constitute the same disability for purposes of section 4.14 if they have overlapping symptomatology.  See Amberman v. Shinseki, 570 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  While the Court noted it was possible for two mental disabilities to have different symptoms and therefore be evaluated separately, if the manifestations of the two mental disabilities were the same, a separate evaluation was not warranted.\r\n\r\nHere, as in Amberman, the Veteran's service connected neurocognitive disorder and his alleged other acquired psychiatric disorders (e.g., PTSD, anxiety, depression, etc.) are evaluated under the same rating criteria.  The symptomatology associated with the disorders would be consequently and necessarily duplicative and overlapping.  The Veteran's neurocognitive disorder is rated as 70 percent disabling and there are no psychiatric symptoms that have been excluded from that rating.  There would simply be no basis for separate evaluations.  See Amberman v. Shinseki, 570 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2009); see also Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).\r\n\r\nAs such, service connection is not warranted for a psychiatric disorder, other than a neurocognitive disorder.  See 38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1110 (2012); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141 (1992); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).\r\n\r\nIn arriving at this conclusion, the Board has also considered the statements made by the Veteran regarding a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder.  The Federal Circuit has held that \"[l]ay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.\"  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007)).\r\n\r\nIn this case, however, the Veteran is not competent to provide testimony regarding a diagnosis and/or etiology of his psychiatric disorder.  See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377, n.4.  Because it is not diagnosed by unique and readily identifiable features, it does not involve a simple identification that a layperson is competent to make.  Therefore, the unsubstantiated statements regarding the claimed diagnosis and etiology of the Veteran's psychiatric disorder are found to lack competency.\r\n\r\nIn light of the above discussion, the Board concludes that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for service connection and there is no doubt to be otherwise resolved.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 5107(b) (2012); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  Therefore, the appeal is denied.\r\n\r\nVA Duty to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Board has given consideration to the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), which includes an enhanced duty on the part of VA to notify a veteran of the information and evidence necessary to substantiate claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 5103, 5103A (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.159 (2017).  The VCAA also redefines the obligations of VA with respect to its statutory duty to assist veterans in the development of their claims.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 5103, 5103A.\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, VA is required to notify the claimant and his representative, if any, of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 5103(a) (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.159(b) (2017); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  Proper notice from VA must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  This notice must be provided prior to an initial unfavorable decision on a claim by the agency of original jurisdiction.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran was provided notice letters informing him of both him and VA's obligations.  Moreover, there is no indication of a failure to notify.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3rd 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015).  Therefore, additional notice is not required and any defect in notice is not prejudicial.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the duty to assist, VA must obtain \"records of relevant medical treatment or examination\" at VA facilities.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 5103A(c)(2).  All records pertaining to the conditions at issue are presumptively relevant.  See Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  In addition, where the Veteran \"sufficiently identifies\" other VA medical records that he or she desires to be obtained, VA must also seek those records even if they do not appear potentially relevant based upon the available information.  Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786, 793 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 3.159(c)(3)).  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that all necessary assistance has been provided to the Veteran.  Indeed, all VA treatment records and relevant private treatment records have been obtained.  The Veteran has also been provided with VA examinations.  Upon review of the examination reports, the Board observes that the examiners reviewed the Veteran's past medical history, recorded his current complaints and history, conducted appropriate evaluations, and rendered appropriate diagnoses and opinions consistent with the remainder of the evidence of record.  The VA examination reports are therefore adequate for the purpose of rendering a decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.2 (2017); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  \r\n\r\nOverall, no further notice or assistance is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist in the development of the above-cited claim.  Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 (2000), aff'd, 281 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); see also Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nNew and material evidence having been received, the application to reopen a previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, characterized as PTSD, is granted, and the claim is reopened.\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, characterized as PTSD and adjustment reaction, and not to include a neurocognitive disorder, is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the Veteran was unable to attend his July 2014 VA examination because he was receiving radiation treatment.  As such, the Board finds that good cause exists for failing to appear, and a new VA examination should be scheduled.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n(Please note, this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 20.900(c).  Expedited handling is requested.)\r\n\r\n1.  Obtain all treatment records from the VA Medical Center in Monroe, Alabama, since October 2015, as well as from any other VA facility from which the Veteran has received treatment.  \r\n\r\nIf the Veteran has received additional private treatment relevant to the issue on appeal, he should be afforded an appropriate opportunity to submit them.  \r\n\r\n2.  Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature, extent, onset and etiology of his skin disability.  The claims file must be provided to the examiner for review.  All indicated studies deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed, and all findings of these tests should be reported in detail. \r\n\r\nThe examiner should specifically provide opinions as to whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e. a 50 percent probability or greater) that the Veteran's skin disability had its onset in, or is otherwise etiologically related to, his active service.  In providing this opinion, the examiner should consider and discuss the Veteran's lay statements regarding this disorder. \r\n\r\nIf the examiner cannot provide any of the requested opinions without resorting to speculation, he or she should provide an explanation stating why this is so.  In so doing, the examiner should explain whether the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for additional information or that he or she has exhausted the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to that particular question(s).\r\n\r\n3.  After the above action is completed, if the claim is not fully granted, a supplemental statement of the case should be issued, and the claims file should be returned to the Board for further appellate consideration.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 5109B, 7112 (2012).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________\r\nB.T.
