the\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Columbia, South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUES\r\n\r\n1.  Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prior to October  25, 2017, and in excess of 70 percent from October 25, 2017.\r\n\r\n2.  Entitlement to a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability (TDIU).\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAppellant represented by:\tThe American Legion\r\n\r\n\r\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nThe Veteran\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nJ. Negron, Associate Counsel \r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from April 1966 to February 1970. \r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2010 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Columbia, South Carolina.  The Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating in November 2008.  The RO entered rating decisions in February 2009, granting an increased rating of 50 percent effective November 2008, and June 2009, denying a rating in excess of 50 percent.  The Veteran filed timely Notices of Disagreement to each of these rating decisions.  In a November 2017 rating decision, the RO granted a rating of 70 percent from October 25, 2017.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in June 2013 by videoconference.  A transcript of the hearing has been associated with the claims file.  \r\n\r\nThe claim for PTSD was brought before the Board in November 2014 and July 2016, with the claim for TDIU, and both were remanded for further development. \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  Prior to October 25, 2017, the probative evidence of record shows the Veteran's PTSD did not manifest to total occupational and social impairment, or occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, family relations, judgment, thinking or mood due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; near continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances; impaired impulse control such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence; and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. \r\n\r\n2.  From October 25, 2017, the probative evidence of record shows the Veteran's PTSD has not manifested to total occupational and social impairment, or occupational and social impairment with persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living; disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.\r\n\r\n3.  Since October 25, 2017, the probative evidence of record shows the Veteran is unable to obtain gainful employment due to his service-connected disability.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1.  The criteria for an increased rating in excess of 50 percent prior to October 25, 2017, for PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1155, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.125, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411 (2017).  \r\n\r\n2.  The criteria for an increased rating in excess of 70 percent from October 25, 2017, for PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1155, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.125, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411 (2017).  \r\n\r\n3.  The criteria for a TDIU rating have been met since October 25, 2017.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 1155, 5110(a), (b)(2) (2012); 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.3, 4.16 (2017).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nLegal Criteria \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that it has reviewed all of the evidence in the Veteran's record, with an emphasis on the evidence that is relevant to this appeal.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no need to discuss in detail every piece of evidence.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F, 3d, 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (VA must review the entire record, but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence).  Rather, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence as deemed appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claims.\r\n\r\nI.  Increased Rating \r\n\r\nDisability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The Board determines the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his/her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, and the assigned rating is based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairment of earning capacity in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1155; 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 4.1, 4.10.  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings should be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. \r\n\u00c2\u00a7 4.7.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1155; 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  However, the evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.14.\r\n\r\nWhen evaluating a mental disorder, the rating agency shall consider the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission.  The rating agency shall assign an evaluation based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.126 (a) (2017).  When evaluating the level of disability from a mental disorder, VA also will consider the extent of social impairment, but shall not assign an evaluation solely on the basis of social impairment.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.126 (b).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  In a claim for a greater original rating after an initial award of service connection, all of the evidence submitted in support of the veteran's claim is to be considered.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet.  App. 119 (1999); 38 C.F.R. \r\n\u00c2\u00a7 4.2.  However, consideration must be given as to whether staged ratings should be assigned to reflect entitlement to a higher rating at any point during the pendency of the claim.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet.  App. 119 (1999); see also Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).\r\n\r\nFactual Analysis - Prior to October 25, 2017\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service-connected PTSD is rated under Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411 of the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  See 38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.130, DC 9411 (2017).\r\n\r\nUnder the applicable rating criteria , a 50 percent disability rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped, speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. Id. \r\n\r\n A 70 percent disability rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id. \r\n\r\nFinally, a 100 percent disability rating is warranted when there is total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. Id.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score is also considered.  GAF is a scale reflecting the psychological, social, and occupational functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental health-illness.  See Richard v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 266, 267 (1996).  A GAF score of 61 to 70 reflects some mild symptoms (e.g., depressed mood and mild insomnia) or some difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., occasional truancy, or theft within the household), but generally functioning pretty well, with some meaningful interpersonal relationships.  Scores ranging from 51 to 60 reflects moderate symptoms, such as flat affect and circumstantial speech, occasional panic attacks, or moderate difficulty in social or occupational functioning (e.g., few friends or conflicts with peers or co-workers).  Scores ranging from 41 to 50 reflect serious symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe obsessional rituals, frequent shoplifting) or any serious impairment in social, occupational or school functioning (e.g., no friends, unable to keep a job).  Scores ranging from 31 to 40 reflect some impairment in reality testing or communication (e.g., speech is at times illogical, obscure, or irrelevant) or major impairment in several areas, such as work or school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, (e.g., depressed man avoids friends, neglects family, and is unable to work).  See Carpenter v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 240, 242-44 (1995).\r\n\r\nHere, prior to October 25, 2017, the Veteran is evaluated as 50 percent disabling.  The evidence of record shows the Veteran has been attending PTSD group sessions and treatment consistently from 2008 to 2017.  In April 2008, the Veteran received a treatment plan review.  The Veteran's strengths were noted as his capacity for empathy, spiritual beliefs, communication skills, and vocational background.  On a scale from 1-10 for severity, with 10 being most severe, his nightmares with insomnia and anxious mood were rated as a 3. \r\n\r\nIn May 2008, the Veteran was seen by a social worker.  The Veteran stated that he was doing well and attending his group sessions regularly and that they have helped him tremendously.  The Veteran stated that his doctor visits and medication have also helped.  He stated that he still suffered from depression and needed more medication since the current medications were working well for him.  The social worker conducted a suicide risk assessment and found the Veteran to be a low risk.  The Veteran lastly noted that he sometimes cannot sleep and his nightmares persist. \r\n\r\nIn August 2008, the Veteran received a suicide risk assessment.  The Veteran denied any suicidal thoughts.  He stated he did feel hopeless but did not engage in behaviors without thinking things through or considering the consequences.  The Veteran stated his psychosocial stressors were financial.  The Veteran had good family/friend relationships, previous positive response to psychotherapy and psychotropic medication.  He was positive and hopeful about the future.  The Veteran had a current good financial status, no substance abuse, or dependency, and had plans to buy a home in the future.  The Veteran reporting doing well, but still had some problems with depression and anxiety.  The social worker then found the Veteran to again be a low suicide risk. \r\n\r\nIn October 2008, the Veteran received another suicide risk assessment.  The Veteran reported not feeling hopeless about the present or future within the last week.  He also reported no thoughts of suicide.  His GAF score was 62.  Following the suicide risk assessment, the Veteran had his treatment review with his VA physician.  The Veteran's strengths were listed as socials skills, financial stability, and access to transportation.  On a scale from 1-10 for severity, with 10 being most severe, his insomnia, flashbacks, and nightmares were a 7, his anger management problems was an 8, and his anxiety attacks were a 7. \r\n\r\nIn December 2008, the Veteran received a mental status examination.  The Veteran's appearance was listed as adequate.  His behavior showed no abnormalities.  His speech was of normal rate and tone, and his attitude was cooperative.

His insight was fair, but impulsive, and his judgment was fair.  \r\n\r\nIn an August 2017 therapy visit, the Veteran reported his current stressor was not losing weight.  He stated he had constant pain from his back and was generally not a happy person.  He stated he continued to pray.  He reported having no friends, but talked to his sister once a week.  The Veteran reported frustration over possibly losing his license again and awaiting urine test results.  The therapist noted the Veteran was casually dressed, alert, and oriented to person, place, time, and situation.  His cognition was organized and orientation was age-appropriate.  His attention and concentration were focused.  His activity level was slow.  His reality testing was intact.  His judgment and self-control were fair.  The Veteran's attitude was positive.  His insight was fair.  His eye contact was good, and his speech was normal.  His affect was full range and his mood was anxious.  The therapist found the Veteran was not a threat to himself or others.\r\n\r\nAfter consideration of the medical and lay evidence, the Board finds that an evaluation in excess of 50 percent prior to October 25, 2017, is not warranted.  During this period, the Veteran's PTSD has been primarily manifested by depression, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, hypervigilance, suspiciousness, social isolation, disturbances of motivation and mood, and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.   \r\n   \r\nThe Board finds that the evidence of record does not support a rating of 70 percent.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran had mentioned having intermittent suicidal thoughts during a March 2010 visit.  However, the Board notes the Veteran only reported this one time and consistently said he would never attempt suicide due to his religious beliefs.  He also did not endorse suicidal ideation throughout the rest of the appeal period and his therapist reported him to be a low suicide risk.  Further, while the Veteran had difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, the evidence consistently shows that the Veteran had not experienced obsessional rituals which interfered with routine activities; speech that was illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene, or near-continuous panic affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively.  Although the Veteran has reported depression throughout the appeal period, it has not manifested to the level of severity of being near-continuous and affecting the Veteran's ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively.  In fact, his therapists have consistently found him competent to handle his financial and daily affairs during this period.  While the Veteran has problems relating to others, he has not demonstrated a complete inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, as he maintained a close relationship with his sister.  Additionally, his therapists have continuously noted the Veteran showed no risk-taking behaviors and appeared to take care of himself well.  Moreover, although he had issues with law enforcement and drinking at one point, the Veteran has predominantly continued to stay sober and attempted to keep his life on track.  The Veteran further often stated his depression and symptoms were better or manageable with medication and often reported feelings of happiness.  Therefore, given the above, the Board does not find that the overall frequency, severity, and duration of the Veteran's PTSD rises to the level of severity as needed for a 70 percent rating prior to October 25, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe Board also finds that the evidence of record does not support a rating of 100 percent.  While the Veteran preferred being alone and had problems relating to others, he was not totally socially impaired, as he maintained a relationship with his sister and spoke to fellow veterans in his group therapy.  The Veteran also stated he was able to maintain his home and keep his mind off disturbing things on a day-to-day basis.  Further, his therapists often noted the Veteran was calm, cooperative, alert, and took good care of himself.  Thus, the evidence does not show that the Veteran has total occupational impairment or intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living.  The Board also notes that the Veteran has no suicide attempts.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's statements that he has a quick temper and issues with anger; however, there has been no evidence of consistent violent or irrational behavior during this period on appeal, nor has the Veteran demonstrated that he was a persistent danger of hurting others, as his therapist consistently noted he was not a risk to himself or others.  Further, these occurrences do not appear to have grossly impaired the Veteran in his thought process/communication or caused grossly inappropriate or consistently aggressive behavior.  The Board notes that the Veteran has mentioned instances of hearing things at night during his January 2009 and March 2010 VA examinations; however, this has not risen to the level of being persistent hallucinations.  The Veteran has shown no disorientation to time or place, or delusions and has maintained a solid memory. \r\n\r\nThe Board also acknowledges the Veteran's assertions that he is entitled to a higher rating because his symptoms were worse.  The Board recognizes that lay persons are competent to provide medical opinions on some medical issues.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  However, the Board has considered the Veteran's statements and finds them credible and consistent with the rating assigned for the period under consideration.\r\n\r\nFrom October 25, 2017\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's PTSD is currently rated as 70 percent disabling from October 25, 2017. \r\n\r\nIn October 2017, the Veteran was given a VA examination.  The examiner wrote the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and/or mood.  The examiner noted the Veteran was living alone in a camper.  The Veteran reported isolating himself and not letting visitors or neighbors come into his home.  He would feed his cat, which was a stray cat.  He still drove and performed ADLs regularly.  The examiner noted the Veteran experienced recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic events, recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or effect of the dream are related to the traumatic event, dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which he feels or acts as if the traumatic events were recurring, intense or prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic events, and marked physiological reactions to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic events.  The Veteran also practices persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with traumatic events by avoidance of efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely related with the traumatic event, and avoidance of or efforts to avoid external reminders, such as people, places, conversations, activities, objects, and situations that arouse distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event.  The Veteran also has persistent negative and exaggerated negative beliefs or expectations about oneself, others, or the world, markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities, and feelings of detachment or estrangement from others.  He also has irritable behavior and angry outbursts that are typically expressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects, hypervigilance, problems with concentration, and sleep disturbance.  The examiner noted the Veteran's symptoms lasted longer than 1 month, caused clinically significant distress, or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, and the disturbance was not attributable to effects of substance use.  The Veteran's overall symptoms were depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, impairment of short and long-term memory, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or work life setting, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, and neglect of hygiene and personal appearance.  The examiner found the Veteran was capable of managing his own affairs.  The examiner noted he showed paranoid ideation regarding others out to harm him or steal from him, and as such, had become more isolated.  He reported a fear that others would hurt his stray cat and planned on keeping it inside during Halloween.  The examiner found his lack of ability to interact socially, along with short term memory and concentration deficit factors would hinder his success in typical occupational setting with significant impact on his ability to maintain employment.  The examiner found the Veteran was not able to carry out multistep tasks, interact appropriately with police, or cope with normal changes in a work routine. \r\n\r\nAfter consideration of the medical and lay evidence, the Board finds that an evaluation in excess of 70 percent from October 25, 2017 is not warranted.  During the period on appeal, the Veteran's PTSD has been primarily manifested by depression, anxiety, short term memory loss, chronic sleep impairment, hypervigilance, suspiciousness, social isolation, disturbances of motivation and mood, impaired impulse control, paranoia, neglect of personal appearance and hygiene, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, and an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.\r\n\r\nThus, as considered above, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not support a rating of 100 percent.  While the Veteran preferred being alone and has primarily isolated himself, he is not totally socially impaired, as he maintains a relationship with his sister.  The Veteran also stated he was able to maintain his home, his finances, and take care of his new cat.  The evidence does not show that the Veteran has an intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living.  The Board also notes that the Veteran has no suicide attempts.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's statements that he has a quick temper, as well as issues with anger and impulse; however, during this period there has been no evidence of violent or irrational behavior, nor has the Veteran demonstrated that he was a danger of hurting others.  Further, the Veteran does not appear to be grossly impaired in his thought process/communication, as he was able to communicate his history with the examiner and stressed his care for his stray cat.  Further, while the Veteran had some impairment in memory, it did not rise to the level of being memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  Lastly, the Board notes that during the examination the Veteran did not report any auditory or visual hallucinations or delusions. \r\n\r\nThe Board also acknowledges the Veteran's assertions that he is entitled to a higher rating because his symptoms were worse.  The Board recognizes that lay persons are competent to provide medical opinions on some medical issues.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  However, the Board has considered the Veteran's statements and finds them credible and consistent with the rating assigned for the period under consideration.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Board concludes that the preponderance of evidence is against the claim and an evaluation in excess of 50 percent prior to October 25, 2017, and in excess of 70 percent from October 25, 2017, is not warranted.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed Cir. 2001).  \r\n\r\nII. TDIU\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he is unemployable due to his service-connected PTSD. \r\n\r\nA total disability rating based upon individual unemployability may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, a total disability rating for compensation purposes may be assigned when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, or if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 4.16 (a). \r\n\r\nHere, the Veteran's PTSD is rated as 70 percent disabling from October 25, 2017.  Thus, the Veteran meets the schedular criteria of a rating of 70 percent or more for an award of TDIU as of October 25, 2017.  Additionally, in the Veteran's October 2017 examination, the examiner found the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and/or mood.  The examiner further stated that the Veteran's lack of ability to interact socially, along with short term memory and concentration deficit factors, would hinder his success in a typical occupational setting with significant impact on his ability to maintain employment.  The examiner also stated that the Veteran is not able to carry out multistep tasks, interact appropriately with police, or cope with normal changes in a work routine.  However, prior to October 25, 2017, the evidence does not show that the Veteran had total occupational impairment due to his PTSD, as he retained some ability to interact socially, had no memory impairment or concentration deficit, and was able to consistently perform the activities of daily living, including managing his own finances.    \r\n\r\nTherefore, upon review of the foregoing evidence, the Board finds that since October 25, 2017, the Veteran is not able to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service-connected PTSD.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran has been rendered unemployable due to his service-connected PTSD and a grant of TDIU is warranted, effective October 25, 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to an evaluation in excess of 50 percent prior to October 15, 2017, and in excess of 70 percent from October 25, 2017 is denied. \r\n\r\nEntitlement to a TDIU is granted, effective October 25, 2017.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________\r\nJENNIFER HWA\r\nVeterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
