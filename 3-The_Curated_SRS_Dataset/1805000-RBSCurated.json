Olson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service from May 1970 to December 1971.\r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following Board Remands in March 2011, May 2014, and February 2016.  This matter was originally on appeal from a November 2007 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) in Huntington, West Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn January 2011, the Veteran testified at a videoconference hearing.  A transcript of that hearing is of record.  \r\n\r\nThe claims file is now entirely in VA's secure electronic processing systems, Virtual VA and Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nDuring the entire appeal period, it is as likely as not, that the Veteran's PTSD has been manifested by occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas; it has not been manifested by total occupational and social impairment.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAWS\r\n\r\nWith resolution of reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, during the entire appeal period, the criteria for an evaluation of 70 percent, but no higher, have been met.  38 U.S.C. Â§ 1155, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411 (2017).\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nPreliminary Matters\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Board's February 2016 Remand, the Appeals Management Center (AMC) obtained an opinion assessing the severity of the Veteran's PTSD, readjudicated the claim, and issued a Supplemental Statement of the Case.  Based on the foregoing actions, the Board finds that there has been compliance with the Board's February 2016 Remand.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).\r\n\r\nAs provided for by the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (2012); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2017).  As service connection, an initial rating, and an effective date have been assigned, the notice requirements of 38 U.S.C. Â§ 5103(a) have been met.   \r\n\r\nVA has fulfilled its duty to assist the Veteran in obtaining identified and available evidence needed to substantiate a claim, and as warranted by law, affording VA examinations.  He was provided the opportunity to present pertinent evidence and testimony.  Moreover, during the January 2011 Board hearing, the undersigned explained the issues on appeal and asked questions designed to elicit evidence that may have been overlooked with regard to the claim. These actions provided an opportunity for the Veteran and his representative to introduce material evidence and pertinent arguments, in compliance with 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.103(c)(2) and consistent with the duty to assist.  In sum, there is no evidence of any VA error in notifying or assisting him that reasonably affects the fairness of this adjudication.  38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.159(c).\r\n\r\nIncreased Rating\r\n\r\nDisability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. Â§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.1.  If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.7.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is appealing the original assignment of a disability evaluation following an award of service connection for PTSD.  As such, it is not the present level of disability which is of primary importance, but rather the entire period is to be considered to ensure that consideration is given to the possibility of staged ratings; that is, separate ratings for separate periods of time based on the facts found.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's PTSD has been rated as 30 percent disabling prior to April 23, 2011,  50 percent disabling from April 23, 2011 to November 23, 2014, and 70 percent disabling from November 24, 2014, under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130, Diagnostic Codes 9411-9440.  \r\n\r\nThe rating schedule provides that a 30 percent rating for PTSD requires occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational task (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, and mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events).  \r\n\r\nThe next higher rating of 50 percent also requires occupational and social impairment, but with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete task); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  \r\n\r\nA 70 percent rating is warranted for even greater occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relationships, judgment, thinking or mood, due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals that interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or \r\ndepression affecting ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  \r\n\r\nThe maximum rating of 100 percent requires total occupational and social impairment due to such symptoms as grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  Id. \r\n\r\nThe psychiatric symptoms listed in the above rating criteria are not exclusive, but are examples of typical symptoms for the listed percentage ratings.  Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).\r\n\r\nIn evaluating the Veteran's level of disability, the Board has considered the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores as one component of the overall disability picture.  GAF is a scale used by mental health professional and reflects psychological, social, and occupational functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental health illness and is relevant in evaluating mental disability.  See Carpenter v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 240, 242 (1995); see also Richard v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 266, 267 (1996) (citing Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. 1994) (DSM-IV)).  Prior to August 4, 2014, VA's Rating Schedule for psychiatric disabilities was based upon the DSM-IV. 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130.  The DSM was updated with a 5th Edition (DSM-5), and VA issued an interim final rule amending certain provisions in the regulations to reflect this update, including the Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  70 Fed. Reg. 45093 ((Aug. 4, 2014).  This updated medical text recommends that GAF scores be dropped due to their \"conceptual lack of clarity.\"  See DSM-5 at 16.  However, since the Veteran's PTSD claim was originally appealed to the Board prior to the adoption of the DSM-V, the DSM-IV criteria, including GAF scores, will be utilized in the Board's analysis.  \r\n\r\nAccording to DSM-IV, a GAF score of 51 to 60 indicates the examinee has moderate symptoms (e.g., flat affect and circumstantial speech, occasional panic attacks) or moderate difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., few friends, conflicts with peers or co-workers).  A GAF score of 41 to 50 indicates the examinee has serious symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe obsessional rituals, frequent shoplifting) or a serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., no friends, unable to keep a job).\r\n\r\nPrior to filing his claim for service connection for PTSD in August 2007, the Veteran was seen for evaluation at the Vet Center in December 2005.  At that time, the examiner noted that the Veteran had been married four times; had complaints of difficulty sleeping, nightmares, and flashbacks; and suffered from depression.  The examiner noted that the Veteran drank eight to twelve beers daily, that he had difficulty with focus and concentration, an exaggerated startle response, and was hypervigilant.  The examiner noted that the Veteran tended to isolate, suffered from survival guilt, and had visual hallucinations on occasion (dark shadowy figures).  The Veteran denied suicidal and homicidal ideation. \r\n\r\nVA treatment records indicate that the Veteran was seen in September 2006 for mental health consultation with complaints of PTSD.  He reported that he had been having problems with anxiety and depression over the prior year.  He reported feeling anxious, moody, irritable, suspicious, hypervigilant, depressed, and lonely.

At that time, the Veteran declined any psychiatric medication.  The Veteran was seen for substance abuse consultation in October 2006, at which time he noted that he had been seeing an outside psychiatrist for PTSD and had been prescribed medication.  \r\n\r\nPrivate medical records of Dr. H. indicate that the Veteran was seen in October 2006 for evaluation of PTSD at which time he reported being hypervigilant, sad, tired, moody, and having poor sleep and problems concentrating.  The Veteran reported not liking crowds.  He also reported having flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, nightmares, avoidance, guilt, startling, and reliving trauma experience in a very uncomfortable way.  The Veteran had concerns about being overly nervous, anxious, tense inside, being unable to relax, and having reduced pleasure.  The Veteran reported having depressed mood, loss of interest, decreased esteem, worry, decreased concentration, discouragement, hopeless feelings, negative outlook, and reduced pleasure.  After mental status examination, the Veteran was diagnosed as having PTSD, and a tentative GAF of 50 was assigned.

In June 2007, the Veteran reported that his anxiety had increased and that his gambling had worsened and was out of control and resisted telling his wife as he was fearful that she would be disappointed.  In July 2007, the Veteran reported that he told his wife about his gambling addiction and that she was angry and shocked.      \r\n\r\nSince the Veteran filed his claim in August 2007, VA treatment records indicate that the Veteran was seen in August 2007 at which time the Veteran reported that he was taking his medications but that sometimes he forgot to take it, that his sleep was fair (four to six hours), and that he was still drinking occasionally but did not take medication and alcohol together.  At that time, the Veteran was oriented, his mood was anxious, he had a full range of affect with no suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, or hallucinations.  He was clean, neat, and tidy.

The Veteran stated, \"I am just having a hard time.  I just can't sleep.  I get nervous, irritable, and snappy.  I stay to myself.  I used to go to bars but now I drink by myself, predominantly beer.\"  The Veteran denied any suicidal attempts.   \r\n\r\nThe Veteran complained of depression, anxiety, agitation, difficulty sleeping, and nightmares.  The Veteran stated that the present situation made it worse and that is irritable and snappy which is why he drinks.

A GAF of 55 was assigned.  The examiner note, \"The patient no doubt is showing features of post-traumatic stress disorder manifesting in the form of depression, anxiety, nightmares, survival guilt ... social isolation which he feels he is containing by drinking which I do not feel is related to his post-traumatic stress disorder although it may be a form of self medication.\"\r\n\r\nVA treatment records indicate that in December 2007, the Veteran reported sleeping approximately five hours per night and not having any nightmares.  \r\n\r\nVet Center records indicate that in December 2007, the Veteran celebrated Christmas with his family, including his 86-year old father.

He also reported that he was not taking any psychiatric medication and last saw a mental health provider in 2011.  The examiner noted that the Veteran continued to reported hypervigilance, nightmares, avoidance, irritability, etc., and that he continued to meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.  The Veteran also reported drinking five or six beers a day.  The examiner stated, \"Based on my interview and exper[ie]nce with this vet his symptoms remain stable.  There is no evidence of worsening in symptom[ato]logy.\"  The examiner noted that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms were manifested by depressed mood, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  After review of the record, the examiner found that the Veteran's PTSD was productive of occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation.  \r\n\r\nIn July 2016, a VA addendum opinion was obtained at which time the examiner, a VA psychiatrist, noted that the assigned GAF was presumed to be:  \"equal to 45 for PTSD\" which is the GAF that was assigned in 2011 and for which the 2014 exam stated:  \"Based on my interview and exper[ie]nce with this vet his symptoms remain stable.  There is no evidence of worsening in symptom[ato]logy,\" which this current examiner interprets as that the previous GAF remains stable and unchanged.  The examiner also noted that the 2011 examiner stated that the alcohol disorder was a result of the PTSD, that the 2014 examiner did not address separate psychiatric diagnoses.  The examiner noted, \r\n\r\nThe veteran's current problem list in CPRS since 2015 list only PTSD and no alcohol or depression.  It can only be assumed, since the veteran has not received any care for his PTSD, depression, or alcohol since 2011 that the only standing diagnosis at this time is continued PTSD and alcohol use, since the veteran disclosed an unchanged amount of daily alcohol use (\"I never miss a happy hour\").  It would be assume from the 2011 exam that all psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms are a result of PTSD, since this was the 2011 examiner's determination.    \r\n\r\nThe Board also notes that the Veteran's PTSD symptom severity has fluctuated during the appeal period which included recurrent intrusive thoughts of traumatic experience, recurrent nightmares, irritability, hypervigilance, depressed and anxious mood, avoidance of events/stimuli associated with traumatic event, guilt feelings.  The Veteran's symptoms also included poor sleep and being withdrawn and isolative.\r\n\r\nIt appears at first glance that the Veteran had no deficiency with respect to family relations.  Although the Veteran reported interpersonal relationship problems resulting in five marriages, the Veteran consistently indicated that he had a happy and stable marriage and received support from his wife.  In September 2006, the Veteran also reported that he had one parent living, his father, two brothers, and 2 sisters and that he had good support system from his family.  In December 2007, the Veteran reported celebrating Christmas with his family including his father.  In October 2008, the Veteran reported that one of his brothers with whom he did not have a good relationship came visited for the first time; they had a good visit and discovered they had a lot in common.  In addition, it appears that the Veteran had friends that he spent time with including gulfing occasionally and drinking.  \r\n\r\nDespite his reports of good relationships, the Veteran has consistently indicated that he mostly stayed to himself, that he belonged to no clubs or organization, and did not attend church.  In January 2011, the Veteran reported that he had no social interactions and about the only person that he trusted was his wife.  The examiner who conducted the April 2010 and April 2011 VA examinations noted in April 2010 that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms affected him socially and were at least moderate at that time and noted in April 2011 that the Veteran's social capacity was severely affected as far as social relationships were concerned related to PTSD.             \r\n\r\nAlthough the Veteran was able to work during the appeal period until his retirement in 2011, the medical professionals indicated that it was possible because he worked alone and that working kept his mind occupied suggesting that the Veteran would have suffered more distress from his PTSD had he not been working.  Even so, the Veteran reported at the October 2007 VA examination that his nervousness, anxiety, and irritability were affecting his job.  The April 2011 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's industrial impairment was moderate to severe but that he was able to hold onto his job because he worked by himself.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, although the Veteran's judgment was noted to be fair on VA examination in October 2007, noted to be intact on VA examinations in April 2010 and April 2011, the Veteran was noted to suffer from alcohol addiction.  Although the VA examinations have demonstrated no cognitive impairment, the Veteran reported problems with concentration.  Although the April 2010 and April 2011 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's major depressive disorder was attributable to nonservice-connected disorders, the October 2007 examiner found that the Veteran was showing features of PTSD manifesting in the form of, inter alia, depression.  The VA psychiatrist in July 2016 found the since the 2011 examination, all psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms, which included depressed mood, could be assumed to be the result of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nFinally, the Board notes that the Veteran's GAF scores assigned during the entire appeal period ranged from 45 to 55.  GAFs of 45 were assigned in August 2007, August 2009, January 2011, on VA examination in April 2011, and by the VA psychiatrist in July 2016 for the November 2014 examination.  The Board notes that GAF scores are not, in and of themselves, the dispositive element in rating a disability; rather they must be considered in light of the actual symptoms of the Veteran's disorder, which provide the primary basis for the rating assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.126 (a) (2017).  Nevertheless, the GAF scores assigned between 45 and 50 indicate serious symptoms or serious impairment in social or occupational functioning and are consistent with the Veteran's PTSD symptomatology.            \r\n\r\nThus, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that during the entire appeal period, the Veteran's PTSD has been productive of occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most area including work, judgment, thinking and mood.  Therefore, the Veteran's symptoms due to PTSD during the entire appeal period exceeded the criteria for the 30 and 50 percent ratings and more nearly approximated the criteria for the 70 percent rating.\r\n\r\nThere, however, has not been any indication of gross impairment in thought processes or communication, persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, persistent danger of hurting himself or others, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, disorientation as to time or place, or memory loss for names of close relative, own occupation or own name.  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms have not exceeded the criteria for a 70-percent rating.  The criteria for a 100 percent rating are met when the veteran experiences total occupational and social impairment, which is clearly not demonstrated in this case. \r\n\r\nUpon consideration of all of the relevant evidence of record, the Board finds that during the entire appeal period, the Veterans PTSD has been manifested by occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas; and that at no time during the appeal period has the Veteran's PTSD been manifested by total occupational and social impairment.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to an initial evaluation of 70 percent, but no higher, for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and episodic alcohol abuse is granted subject to the law and regulations governing the payment of monetary benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL D.
