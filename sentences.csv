1801071P13S2,,Sentence,"A. Smith, Associate Counsel"
1801071P14S1,,Sentence,INTRODUCTION
1801071P15S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from August 1976 to August 1980.
1801071P16S2,,Sentence,"This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2011 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida."
1801071P17S2,,Sentence,The Veteran requested a hearing before a travel board.
1801071P17S3,,Sentence,"In a May 2017 statement from his representative, the Veteran canceled his request for a hearing."
1801071P17S4,,EvidenceSentence,There are no additional requests for a hearing of record.
1801071P17S5,,Sentence,"As such, the Board considers the Veteran's request for a hearing satisfied."
1801071P17S6,,CitationSentence,"See 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 20.702(e), 20.704(e) (2017)."
1801071P18S2,,EvidenceSentence,"As will be discussed, the record does not reflect a diagnosis for PTSD."
1801071P18S3,,Sentence,"However, the Board has considered whether the record suggests other psychiatric conditions as well pursuant to Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 4-6 (2009)."
1801071P18S4,,Sentence,"As such, the Board has recharacterized the issue for PTSD as reflected on the title page."
1801071P19S1,,Sentence,The issue of service connection for a back disability is addressed in the REMAND portion of the decision below and is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).
1801071P20S1,,Sentence,FINDINGS OF FACT
1801071P21S2,,Sentence,1.
1801071P21S3,,FindingSentence,"In an April 2009 decision, the Board determined that new and material evidence had not been received sufficient to reopen a claim for service connection for a back condition."
1801071P22S2,,Sentence,2.
1801071P22S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"The evidence associated with the claims file subsequent to the April 2009 Board decision relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim for service connection for a back condition, is not cumulative or redundant of the evidence previously of record, and is sufficient to raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim."
1801071P23S2,,Sentence,3.
1801071P23S3,,EvidenceSentence,The record does not reflect a current diagnosis or persistent or recurrent symptomatology for PTSD or another psychiatric disorder.
1801071P24S1,,Sentence,CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1801071P25S2,,Sentence,1.
1801071P25S3,,Sentence,New and material evidence has been received to reopen a claim of entitlement to service connection for a back condition.

1801071P26S3,,FindingSentence,"The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD have not been met."

1801071P27S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
1801071P28S2,,Sentence,Duties to Assist and Notify
1801071P29S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,VA has a duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating claims for VA benefits.
1801071P29S3,,CitationSentence,See e.g.
1801071P29S4,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 5103, 5103A and 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.159."
1801071P29S5,FindingSentence,EvidenceSentence,"For the issues decided herein, VA provided adequate notice in a letter sent to the Veteran in February 2011."
1801071P30S2,,EvidenceSentence,"With regard to the duty to assist, VA has obtained all identified and available service and post-service treatment records."
1801071P30S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Board acknowledges the representative's statement that VA did not fulfill its duty to assist by failing to provide the Veteran a VA examination regarding his PTSD claim.
1801071P30S4,ReasoningSentence,FindingSentence,"However, an examination is not warranted as the record does not reflect persistent or recurrent symptoms or a current diagnosis of PTSD or another psychiatric condition."
1801071P30S5,,CitationSentence,"See McClendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.159(c)(4)."
1801071P30S6,FindingSentence,Sentence,"Accordingly, the Board finds VA has satisfied its duty to assist the Veteran in the development of the claim."
1801071P31S2,FindingSentence,ReasoningSentence,"As VA satisfied its duties to notify and assist the Veteran, the Board finds that there is no further action to be undertaken to comply with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. Â§ 5103(a), Â§ 5103A, or 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.159 and that the Veteran will not be prejudiced as a result of the Board's adjudication of this claim."
1801071P32S2,,Sentence,New and Material Evidence
1801071P33S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Generally, a claim that has been denied in a final unappealed rating decision may not thereafter be reopened and allowed."
1801071P33S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 7104, 7105."
1801071P33S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Similarly, a decision by the Board is final unless the Chairman of the Board orders reconsideration of the decision."
1801071P33S5,,CitationSentence,See 38 U.S.C. Â§ 7103(a); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 20.1100(a).
1801071P34S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"An exception to this rule is 38 U.S.C. Â§ 5108, which provides that if new and material evidence is presented or secured with respect to a claim which has been disallowed, VA will reopen the claim and review it on the merits."
1801071P35S2,,LegalRuleSentence,New evidence is defined as existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decision makers.
1801071P35S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Material evidence means evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim."
1801071P35S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"New and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence previously of record, and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim."
1801071P35S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.156(a).
1801071P36S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In determining whether evidence is new and material, the credibility of the evidence is generally presumed."
1801071P36S3,,CitationSentence,"Justus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 512-513 (1992)."
1801071P36S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held, however, that evidence that is merely cumulative of other evidence in the record cannot be new and material even if that evidence had not been previously presented to the Board."
1801071P36S5,,CitationSentence,"Anglin v. West, 203 F.3d 1343 (2000)."
1801071P37S2,,LegalRuleSentence,Entitlement to service connection requires: (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the in-service disease or injury and the current disability.
1801071P37S3,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(a); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)."
1801071P38S2,,Sentence,Analysis
1801071P39S2,,Sentence,"In an April 2009 Board decision, the Board denied reopening the Veteran's claim for service connection for a back condition because the medical reports submitted, while new, did not speak to a nexus and in-service illness or injury regarding the Veteran's back."
1801071P40S2,,Sentence,"In January 2011, the Veteran filed a claim to reopen for service connection for a back condition."
1801071P40S3,,EvidenceSentence,Service treatment records (STRs) uploaded to VBMS in June 2014 include a September 1978 report indicating complaints of back pain.
1801071P40S4,,EvidenceSentence,"While prior rating decisions indicate that the Veteran's STRs from 1976 to 1980 were reviewed, previous rating decisions do not mention the September 1978 in-service report of back pain."
1801071P40S5,,EvidenceSentence,The Board's review of the STRs available at the time of the previous denial revealed that those STRs do not reflect the September 1978 report of back pain.
1801071P40S6,,ReasoningSentence,"As such, the Board determines that the evidence is new."
1801071P40S7,,ReasoningSentence,Nor is the evidence cumulative or redundant of any evidence already of record.
1801071P40S8,,FindingSentence,"Additionally, as the STRs speak to an in-service incurrence, the Board finds that the new evidence raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a back condition."
1801071P41S2,FindingSentence,Sentence,"Hence, the low threshold for meeting the criteria for reopening has been met."
1801071P41S3,,CitationSentence,"Shade v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 110, 117-118 (2010)."
1801071P41S4,,Sentence,"Accordingly, the claim of entitlement to service connection for a back condition is reopened."
1801071P41S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.156(a).
1801071P42S2,,Sentence,Service Connection
1801071P43S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran contends that he has PTSD as a result of his active service.
1801071P44S2,,Sentence,There are particular requirements for establishing service connection for PTSD.
1801071P44S3,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f); Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010)."
1801071P44S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"Service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125; (2) credible supporting evidence of an in-service stressor; and (3) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor."
1801071P44S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f).
1801071P45S2,,FindingSentence,"In the instant case, the record does not reflect a diagnosis for PTSD."
1801071P45S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125(a) requires that a diagnosis of PTSD be in accordance with either the 4th or 5th edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV, DSM-5)."
1801071P45S4,,Sentence,Which DSM is applicable is based on when the appeal was certified to the Board.
1801071P45S5,,EvidenceSentence,"However, the record in this case does not reflect any PTSD diagnosis per either DSM."
1801071P45S6,,ReasoningSentence,"The only medical evidence of record relating to PTSD is an October 2004 PTSD screening from Miami VA Medical Center (VAMC), and the screening was negative for PTSD."
1801071P45S7,,FindingSentence,"As the record does not reflect a current diagnosis for PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125, the cornerstone element of service connection has not been met, and service connection is not warranted."
1801071P45S8,,CitationSentence,"See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992) (a current diagnosis is a cornerstone of service connection)."
1801071P46S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The Board acknowledges that the Court has held that when a veteran claims service connection, he or she is not claiming service connection for a specific diagnosis but for his or her symptoms regardless of the diagnosis, and the claim encompasses the underlying condition regardless of diagnosis."
1801071P46S3,,CitationSentence,"Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 4-6 (2009)."
1801071P46S4,,Sentence,"As such, as mentioned in the Introduction, the Board has considered whether the record suggests psychiatric conditions other than PTSD."
1801071P46S5,,EvidenceSentence,"However in this case, the record does not reflect any psychiatric disorder diagnoses or persistent or recurrent symptomatology of a psychiatric condition."
1801071P46S6,,EvidenceSentence,A January 2011 depression screening from Miami VAMC was negative and indicates that the Veteran does not meet the referral criteria for depression or anxiety.
1801071P46S7,,FindingSentence,"As such, the Board finds that the record does not suggest other psychiatric conditions."
1801071P47S2,,FindingSentence,"In light of the evidence, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence does not support service connection for PTSD or another psychiatric condition."
1801071P47S3,,Sentence,"Accordingly, service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, to include PTSD is denied."
1801071P48S1,,Sentence,ORDER
1801071P49S2,,FindingSentence,"As new and material evidence has been received, the claim for service connection for a back condition is reopened."
1801071P50S2,,Sentence,"Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, to include PTSD is denied."
1801071P51S1,,Sentence,REMAND
1801071P52S2,,ReasoningSentence,The record reflects a current back condition and suggests an in-service incurrence but is insufficient to decide the claim as there is no nexus opinion of record.
1801071P52S3,,ReasoningSentence,"As such, the Board finds that the duty to assist has been triggered and a VA examination regarding the Veteran's current back condition is necessary."
1801071P52S4,,CitationSentence,"See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. at 81; 38 U.S.C. Â§ 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.159(c)(4)(i)."
1801071P52S5,,ReasoningSentence,"As such, the issue is remanded for a VA examination and opinion."
1801071P53S1,,Sentence,"Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:"
1801071P54S2,,Sentence,1.
1801071P54S3,,EvidenceSentence,Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate examiner to assess the nature and etiology of the Veteran's current back condition.
1801071P55S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The claims file and a copy of this remand must be made available to the reviewing examiner, and the examiner should indicate in the report that the claims file was reviewed."
1801071P56S2,,ReasoningSentence,Any opinion provided must be accompanied by a rationale and must take the Veteran's lay statements into consideration.
1801071P56S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to attest to observable symptoms, such as pain."
1801071P56S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the Veteran's reports of symptomatology, the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation."
1801071P57S2,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner is asked to provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50 percent or greater probability) that the Veteran's back condition was caused by or is otherwise related to the Veteran's active service.
1801071P58S2,,Sentence,2.
1801071P58S3,,Sentence,"After completing the above actions, readjudicate the claim on appeal."
1801071P58S4,,Sentence,"If the benefits sought on appeal remain denied, the Veteran should be furnished an appropriate supplemental statement of the case and provided an opportunity to respond."
1801071P59S2,,Sentence,The appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.
1801071P59S3,,CitationSentence,"Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999)."
1801071P60S2,,Sentence,This claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.
1801071P60S3,,LegalRuleSentence,The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.
1801071P60S4,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 5109B, 7112 (West 2012)."

1801134P13S2,,Sentence,"K. Laffitte, Associate Counsel"
1801134P14S1,,Sentence,INTRODUCTION
1801134P15S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from September 1966 to August 1969.
1801134P16S2,,Sentence,"This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2011 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Houston, Texas, that denied the Veteran a rating greater than 50 percent for PTSD."
1801134P17S2,,Sentence,"In a February 2015 rating decision the RO increased the Veteran's disability rating to 70 percent disabling from April 30, 2014."
1801134P18S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In December 2017, the Veteran was scheduled for a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge for which he failed to report."
1801134P18S3,,ReasoningSentence,"As the Veteran has not provided good cause for his failure to report, and has not since requested that the hearing be rescheduled, his hearing request is, therefore, deemed withdrawn."
1801134P18S4,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 20.702 (d); 20.704(d) (2017).
1801134P19S1,,Sentence,FINDING OF FACT
1801134P20S2,,FindingSentence,"For the entirety of the appeal period, the Veteran's PTSD manifested to a degree of occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas; but not total occupational and social impairment."
1801134P21S1,,Sentence,CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1801134P22S2,,Sentence,1.
1801134P22S3,,FindingSentence,"Giving all reasonable doubt to the Veteran, for the period prior to April 30, 2014, the criteria for a 70 percent disability rating for PTSD have been met."
1801134P22S4,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1155, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411 (2017)."
1801134P23S2,,Sentence,2.
1801134P23S3,,FindingSentence,At no time during the appeal period have the criteria for a disability rating greater than 70 percent for PTSD been met.
1801134P23S4,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1155, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411 (2017)."
1801134P24S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS
1801134P25S2,FindingSentence,Sentence,VA has complied with the duties to notify and assist in this case.
1801134P25S3,,EvidenceSentence,Notice was provided to the Veteran and no assertions of error have been raised with regard to the notice provided.
1801134P26S2,,Sentence,"With regard to the duty to assist, in the December 2017 Informal Hearing Presentation, the Veteran's representative asserts that because the last examination took place in September 2014, and thus, a new examination is required as his condition has worsened in the ensuing 3 years."
1801134P26S3,,FindingSentence,"The representative does not point to any evidence in the record to support this assertion, and to the contrary, the Board finds that review of the record indicates that the Veteran's symptomatology did not increase in severity during this period, and in fact, appears to have improved."
1801134P26S4,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,The mere passage of time between the last examination and the Board's review does not automatically render the examination inadequate; there must be evidence of a change in the condition.
1801134P26S5,,CitationSentence,"Palczewski v. Nicholson, 21 Vet.App. 174, 182 (2007)."
1801134P26S6,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's PTSD was evaluated as 70 percent disabling during this period, with symptoms that satisfied or equated to this level of disability."
1801134P26S7,,EvidenceSentence,"For the period after the September 2014 examination, in October 2014, the Veteran reported that he slept well and only had nightmares from time to time."
1801134P26S8,,EvidenceSentence,"He denied depression and suicidal ideations, and reported that he goes fishing 2 to 3 times a week, and that he enjoys talking, and enjoys life."
1801134P26S9,,EvidenceSentence,"Similarly in June 2015 and in October 2016, the Veteran reported that he slept well, enjoyed working around the house, and walking his dog."
1801134P26S10,,EvidenceSentence,"He again denied depression, suicidal ideation, and noted that he enjoyed life."
1801134P26S11,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, most recently in August 2017, a Pharmacy Clinical Note indicated that the Veteran's psychiatric condition was stable, and that he is well-controlled on his current therapy."
1801134P26S12,,ReasoningSentence,"Accordingly, absent a showing of worsening in the record, despite the assertions made by the representative, the Board does not find that a new examination due to worsening of the condition is warranted here."
1801134P27S2,,Sentence,Increased Ratings for PTSD
1801134P28S2,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"Disability evaluations (ratings) are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule)."
1801134P28S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1155 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10 (2017)."
1801134P29S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In evaluating a disability, the Board considers the current examination reports in light of the whole recorded history to ensure that the current rating accurately reflects the severity of the condition."
1801134P29S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,The Board has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations that are potentially applicable.
1801134P29S4,CitationSentence,Sentence,"Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991)."
1801134P29S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"The medical, as well as industrial history is to be considered, and a full description of the effects of the disability upon ordinary activity is also required."
1801134P29S6,CitationSentence,Sentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10 (2017)."
1801134P31S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating."
1801134P31S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned."

1801134P34S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Under the General Rating Formula, a 50 percent rating is assigned when a veteran's PTSD causes occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short-term and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships."

1801134P41S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Pertinent to this case, GAF scores ranging from 61 to 70 indicate that a veteran has some mild psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depressed mood and mild insomnia) or experiences some difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., occasional truancy, or theft within the household); however, the veteran is found to generally be functioning pretty well and has some meaningful interpersonal relationships."
1801134P41S5,,EvidenceSentence,"GAF scores ranging from 51 to 60 indicate moderate symptoms (e.g., flat affect and circumstantial speech, occasional panic attacks) or moderate difficulty in social or occupational functioning (e.g., few friends, conflicts with peers and co-workers)."
1801134P41S6,,EvidenceSentence,"GAF scores of 41 to 50 indicate serious symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe obsessional rituals, frequent shoplifting) or any serious impairment in social or occupational functioning (e.g., no friends, unable to keep a job)."

1801134P42S2,,Sentence,Factual Background
1801134P43S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran contends that his service-connected PTSD warrants a higher disability rating.
1801134P44S2,,EvidenceSentence,"On September 10, 2010, the Veteran received a VA examination to determine the severity of his PTSD."
1801134P44S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran reported symptoms of sleep impairment, panic attacks, chronic dysphoria, tearfulness, and suicidal ideations, but denied hallucinations or delusions."
1801134P44S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran further reported that he keeps to himself, and that he has obsessive rituals including checking locks 5-6 times per night and compulsively counting items."
1801134P44S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and Histrionic Personality Disorder noting that the Veteran's personality disorder heightens the Veteran's symptoms, but that it is not causative of his PTSD, anxiety, or depressive symptoms."
1801134P44S6,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner also determined that the Veteran exhibited some borderline hypo-manic symptoms, but that he was primarily depressed."
1801134P44S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner found that the Veteran had a GAF score of 49, and that the Veteran did not have total occupational and social impairment due to his PTSD symptoms, but that his symptoms did result in deficiencies in judgment, thinking, family relations, work, mood, and concentration."
1801134P45S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In a May 2011 Psychiatry visit, the Veteran reported being easily startled and being awakened from nightmares about 4-5 times per week."
1801134P45S3,,EvidenceSentence,"He further reported sleep impairment, anxiety, being easily irritated, crying spells, and that he smokes marijuana daily to help him to relax."
1801134P45S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD with marijuana abuse, and determined that the Veteran had a GAF score of 60."
1801134P46S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Subsequently, in September 2011, the Veteran received another VA examination to determine the severity of his PTSD symptoms."
1801134P46S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran reported symptoms of sadness, anxiety, increased arousal, and avoidance."
1801134P46S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran further reported sleep impairment and nightmares, but denied any suicide attempts."
1801134P46S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran described the relationships with his wife, siblings, and children as good."
1801134P46S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Occupationally, the Veteran reported having been employed as a welder for 30 years, and that he has not worked in 21 years due to the effects of his mental condition."
1801134P46S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner noted that the Veteran exhibited mood swings, anxiety, impaired attention and/or focus, problems concentrating, and that marijuana contributes to the Veteran's depressed mood."
1801134P46S8,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner further noted that panic attacks are absent, but that the Veteran has mild memory impairment, and passive thoughts of death."
1801134P46S9,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner determined that the Veteran had a GAF score of 51, and that the Veteran's symptoms are best described as causing occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency."
1801134P47S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In April 2012, the Veteran was admitted to a Behavioral Health Treatment Program for PTSD."
1801134P47S3,,EvidenceSentence,A risk assessment determined that the Veteran was a danger to himself and/or others due to having poor impulse control and suicidal ideations.
1801134P47S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner noted problems of tension, difficulty relaxing, unwanted memories, anger/irritability, relationship problems, and poor communication skills."
1801134P47S5,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner also determined that the Veteran had a GAF score of 49.
1801134P48S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In September 2014, the Veteran received a Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ), for purposes of a PTSD review."
1801134P48S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner noted that the Veteran exhibited symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, and panic attacks."
1801134P48S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner further noted symptoms of mild memory loss, disturbances of motivation and mood, obsessional rituals, and delusions or hallucinations."
1801134P48S5,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner determined that the Veteran's PTSD condition has progressed and that the Veteran's depression exacerbates his PTSD symptoms.
1801134P48S6,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner further found that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.
1801134P49S2,,Sentence,Legal Analysis
1801134P50S2,ReasoningSentence,FindingSentence,"The Veteran's PTSD has been rated in stages with a 50 percent rating from September 10, 2010, and a 70 percent rating from April 30, 2014."
1801134P51S2,,FindingSentence,"The Board finds that prior to April 30, 2014, a higher rating of 70 percent is warranted; however, that the criteria for a total rating for PTSD have not been met at any time during the appeal period."
1801134P52S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Board notes that in his September 10, 2010 examination, the Veteran reported suicidal ideations, chronic dysphoria, panic attacks, and obsessive rituals."
1801134P52S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner determined that the Veteran had a GAF score of 49, indicative of serious symptoms."
1801134P52S4,,EvidenceSentence,"In contrast, a May 2011 Psychiatry Note, noted that the Veteran had a GAF score of 60, indicative of moderate symptoms."
1801134P52S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Similarly, in his September 2011 VA examination, the examiner determined that the Veteran had a GAF score of 51, also indicative of moderate symptoms."
1801134P52S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Finally, after being admitted to a treatment program for PTSD in April 2012, the examiner determined that the Veteran had a GAF score of 49, again, denoting serious symptoms."
1801134P52S7,,EvidenceSentence,"Notably, the evidence shows that the Veteran was discharged from the program, and was subsequently referred to mental health at the VA Corpus Christi, OPC."
1801134P53S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's September 2014 DBQ, the examiner determined that the Veteran's PTSD condition progressed and that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas."
1801134P53S3,,EvidenceSentence,"In October 2014, the Veteran reported that he sleeps well and has nightmares from time to time."
1801134P53S4,,EvidenceSentence,"He denied depression and suicidal ideations, and reported that he goes fishing 2 to 3 times a week, and that he enjoys talking, and enjoys life."
1801134P53S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Similarly in June 2015 and in October 2016, the Veteran reported that he sleeps well, enjoys working around the house, and walking his dog."
1801134P53S6,,EvidenceSentence,"He again denied depression, suicidal ideation, and that he enjoys life."
1801134P53S7,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, most recently in August 2017, a Pharmacy Clinical Note indicated that the Veteran's psychiatric condition was stable, and that he is well-controlled on his current therapy."
1801134P54S2,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, considering the evidence above, the Board finds that, giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt given the noted fluctuation in the severity of his symptomatology during the period prior to April 30, 2014, that his symptoms for this entire period more nearly approximate the criteria for a 70 percent rating."
1801134P54S3,,ReasoningSentence,"However, in considering a higher rating, the Board finds that at no time during the appeal period was the Veteran's symptomatology representative of total social impairment."
1801134P54S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Socially, he maintained relationships with his family, engaged in fishing, and walked the dog."
1801134P54S5,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"While he demonstrated some of the criteria for a 100 percent rating during his 2012 admission, overall his symptoms even during this period more nearly approximate the level of disability in the 70 percent rating rather than the total rating."
1801134P54S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, his symptomatology improved upon release."
1801134P54S7,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The Board also recognizes his occasional reports of suicidal ideation and thoughts, however, again, these symptoms are compensated and considered as part of the 70 percent rating."
1801134P54S8,,FindingSentence,"As the evidence preponderates against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable, and an increased rating must be denied."
1801134P54S9,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§ 5107 (b) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102; 4.3; Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53-56."
1801134P55S2,,FindingSentence,"Accordingly, the Board fins that an increase to 70 percent disabling, but no higher, for the entire appeal period, before and after April 30, 2014, is warranted."
1801134P55S3,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C. Â§ 5107 (b) (2012); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102; 4.3 (2017); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56."

1801535P12S2,,Sentence,"D. Abdelbary, Associate Counsel"
1801535P13S1,,Sentence,INTRODUCTION
1801535P14S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran served on active duty from January 1968 to January 1970.
1801535P15S2,,Sentence,"This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2010 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Paul, Minnesota, which granted entitlement to service connection for PTSD at a 30-percent rating."
1801535P15S3,,Sentence,"Jurisdiction was subsequently transferred to the RO in Los Angeles, California, and that office forwarded this appeal to the Board."
1801535P16S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In a March 2014 VA Form 9, in addition to filing a substantive appeal as to the initial rating of 30 percent to his service-connected PTSD, the Veteran also stated that his PTSD has rendered him unemployable."
1801535P16S3,,Sentence,"Entitlement to TDIU is considered a part of the Veteran's claim for entitlement to an increased rating for PTSD, based on the Court's holding in Rice v. Shinseki."
1801535P16S4,,CitationSentence,22 Vet. App. 453 (a TDIU request in which the disability is already service connected is not a separate claim for benefits but rather is part of a claim for increased compensation); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.400 (2017).
1801535P16S5,,Sentence,"Given such, the Board has jurisdiction over this claim, and will be further explained below."
1801535P17S2,,Sentence,"In an October 2014 rating decision, the RO increased the Veteran's rating from 30 percent to 50 percent effective October 3, 2014."
1801535P17S3,,ReasoningSentence,"Thus, for the period from October 3, 2014, as this decision reflects a partial grant of the benefits sought on appeal for this issue, the Veteran's claim is considered to be in appellate status as maximum benefits were not granted."
1801535P17S4,,CitationSentence,"See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993) (indicating that where a claimant has filed a notice of disagreement as to a decision assigning a particular rating, a subsequent decision awarded a higher rating, but less than the maximum available benefit, does not abrogate the appeal)."
1801535P18S2,,EvidenceSentence,"As for the matter of representation, the record reflects that, the Veteran filed an Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative (VA Form 21-22) appointing the American Legion as his power of attorney (POA) in May 2009."
1801535P18S3,,EvidenceSentence,"In August 2017, the Veteran provided another POA and filed a new VA Form 21-22, appointing the Military Order of the Purple Heart, as his representative."
1801535P18S4,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board notes that a POA may be revoked at any time, and unless specifically noted otherwise, receipt of a new POA constitutes a revocation of an existing POA."
1801535P18S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 14.631 (f)(1) (2017).
1801535P18S6,,Sentence,"As of August 2017, the Veteran's representative is Military Order of the Purple Heart."
1801535P18S7,,Sentence,The Board recognizes this change in representation.
1801535P19S2,,Sentence,"The issue of entitlement to service connection for depression has been raised by the record in a March 12, 2014 statement by the Veteran, but has not been adjudicated by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ)."
1801535P19S3,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction over it, and it is referred to the AOJ for appropriate action."

1801535P31S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"Here, prior to October 3, 2014, the Veteran's PTSD was evaluated at a 30-percent disability rating."
1801535P31S3,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"From October 3, 3014, the Veteran's PTSD is evaluated at a 50-percent disability rating."
1801535P31S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,All psychiatric disabilities are evaluated under a general rating formula for mental disorders.
1801535P32S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Under DC 9411, a 30-percent disability rating is assigned when there is occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events)."
1801535P33S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The next higher 50-percent rating is assigned when there is occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships."
1801535P34S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Under DC 9411, a 70-percent rating is assigned when the psychiatric condition produces occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.)."
1801535P35S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A maximum 100-percent rating is assigned when there is total occupational or social impairment due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place, memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name."
1801535P35S3,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130, DC 9411."
1801535P36S2,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"When determining the appropriate disability evaluation to assign, the Board's primary consideration is a veteran's symptoms, but it must also make findings as to how those symptoms impact a veteran's occupational and social impairment."
1801535P36S3,,CitationSentence,"Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002)."
1801535P36S4,,ReasoningSentence,"Because the use of the term ""such as"" in the rating criteria demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, the Board need not find the presence of all, most, or even some, of the enumerated symptoms to award a specific rating."
1801535P36S5,,CitationSentence,"Id. at 442; see also Sellers v. Principi, 372 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2004)."
1801535P36S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"Nevertheless, all ratings in the general rating formula are also associated with objectively observable symptomatology and the plain language of the regulation makes it clear that the veteran's impairment must be ""due to"" those symptoms, a veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration."
1801535P36S7,,CitationSentence,"Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 118."
1801535P37S2,,ReasoningSentence,"As such, the Board will consider both the Veteran's specific symptomatology as well as the occupational and social impairment associated with the DC to determine whether an increased evaluation is warranted."
1801535P38S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"It should be noted that prior to August 4, 2014, VA's Rating Schedule that addresses service connected psychiatric disabilities was based upon the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, of the American Psychiatric Association (also known as ""DSM-IV"")."
1801535P38S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130.
1801535P38S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Like this case, diagnoses many times included a Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score."
1801535P38S5,,Sentence,"The DSM was recently updated with a 5th Edition (DSM-5), and VA issued an interim final rule amending certain provisions in the regulations to reflect this update, including the Schedule for Rating Disabilities."
1801535P38S6,,Sentence,"70 Fed. Reg. 45093 (Aug. 4, 2014)."
1801535P38S7,Sentence,EvidenceSentence,"This updated medical text recommends that GAF scores be dropped due to their ""conceptual lack of clarity."""
1801535P38S8,,CitationSentence,See DSM-5 at 16.
1801535P39S2,,Sentence,"According to DSM-IV, the GAF is a scale reflecting the psychological, social, and occupational functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental health illness."
1801535P39S3,,CitationSentence,"Carpenter v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 240 (1995)."
1801535P39S4,,ReasoningSentence,There is no question that the GAF score and interpretations of the score are important considerations in rating a psychiatric disability.
1801535P39S5,,CitationSentence,"See, e.g., Richard v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 266, 267 (1996); Carpenter v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 240 (1995)."
1801535P39S6,,ReasoningSentence,"Although, the GAF score assigned in a case, like an examiner's assessment of the severity of a condition, is not dispositive of the evaluation issue; rather, the GAF score must be considered in light of the actual symptoms of the Veteran's disorder, which provide the primary basis for the rating assigned."
1801535P39S7,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.126 (a).
1801535P40S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"As with all claims for VA disability compensation, the Board must assess the credibility and weigh all the evidence, including lay and medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant."

1801535P71S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In an April 2011 VA Research Note, the Veteran reported that nearly every day for the past two weeks he has had little interest or pleasure in doing things, feelings of being down, depressed, or hopeless, little energy, a poor appetite, and bad feelings about himself."

1801535P73S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Throughout the Veteran's VA medical records there is no indication that the Veteran had any suicidal or homicidal ideation, obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; spatial disorientation; gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name."
1801535P74S2,FindingSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Based on the foregoing evidence, the Veteran's PTSD has caused a variety of psychiatric symptoms, from the 30-percent rating as well as the 50-percent, to include depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks, chronic sleep impairment, flattened affect, difficulty understanding commands, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships."
1801535P74S3,,FindingSentence,"Where a Veteran's disability falls between two ratings criteria, the Board finds that although the intensity of the individual symptoms varied, the chronic nature of the duration and frequency of his PTSD symptoms reflect the severity of the Veteran's PTSD which most nearly approximates a 50 percent rating."
1801535P75S2,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"In short, the record demonstrates occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to the Veteran's PTSD symptoms."
1801535P75S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Board recognizes that the May 2010 VA psychiatric evaluation yielded a GAF score of 60, which would reflect only ""moderate"" impairment."
1801535P75S4,,CitationSentence,See Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 32 (4th ed.1994).
1801535P75S5,,EvidenceSentence,"And the Veteran's October 2014 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's PTSD is productive of occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, which alone would be consistent with a 30 percent rating."
1801535P75S6,,ReasoningSentence,"However, based on consideration of the entire evidence of record as outlined above, the Veteran has exhibited symptoms throughout the appeal period that, while not squarely within the symptomatology consistent with a 50-percent rating, more nearly approximates the criteria for a 50-percent rating."
1801535P75S7,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.7.
1801535P76S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Specifically, in the May 2010 VA examination report, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran's difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships."
1801535P76S3,,EvidenceSentence,"This is evident by the fact that the Veteran has difficulty maintaining employment, was divorced twice, and does not have a good relationship with his children."
1801535P76S4,,EvidenceSentence,"In a February 2014 High Desert Vet Center medical record, the Veteran's therapist noted that the Veteran had a history of poor relationships, and opined that the Veteran's symptoms are persistent and chronic in nature, finding that these conditions severely impair the Veteran's ability to function at home and in the community."
1801535P76S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Also, in the Veteran's October 2014 DBQ, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran's PTSD causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, based on symptoms of a flattened affect, disturbances of motivation and mood, and difficulty in adapting to stressful situations, including work or a work like setting."
1801535P77S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In conjunction with the Veteran's medical records, the Veteran's lay statements and numerous buddy statements, similarly reflect the Veteran's continued and chronic PTSD symptoms."
1801535P77S3,,FindingSentence,"Thus collectively, the evidence reflects the Veteran's PTSD is productive of occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity based on the above PTSD symptoms."
1801535P78S2,,FindingSentence,"Moreover, at no point during the appeal period has the Veteran's PTSD been shown to have met the criteria for a higher, 70- or 100- percent rating."
1801535P78S3,,EvidenceSentence,"As noted above, the VA examinations and his medical treatment records do not reflect at any point in which the Veteran exhibited symptoms, such as, and to include, suicidal ideation, obsessional rituals that interfere with routine activities, speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant, near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively, impaired impulse control, spatial disorientation, or neglect of personal hygiene."
1801535P79S2,,FindingSentence,"Additionally, the aforementioned evidence reflects that there is no evidence of psychosis in the record."
1801535P79S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Again, throughout the entire record, the Veteran has consistently denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation, or any delusions or hallucinations."
1801535P79S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Although the Veteran has had violent incidents in his past, the VA medical records do not reflect that the Veteran is an imminent threat to himself or others."
1801535P79S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The medical records do not show that the Veteran exhibited symptoms of grossly inappropriate behavior, persistent delusions or hallucinations, persistent danger of hurting himself or others, intermittent inability to perform daily living, disorientation to time living or place, memory loss of close relatives, own occupation or own name."
1801535P79S6,,ReasoningSentence,"Thus, the Veteran's overall PTSD symptoms are not productive of total and social impairment."
1801535P80S2,,Sentence,The Board has also considered the Veteran's statements regarding his PTSD symptoms.
1801535P80S3,,ReasoningSentence,The Veteran's statements are competent evidence as to the symptoms of his PTSD as this comes to him through his senses.
1801535P80S4,,ReasoningSentence,"Moreover, his statements are credible to the extent that they are consistent with the medical evidence of the record."
1801535P80S5,,ReasoningSentence,"However, his statements are not competent evidence as to a specific level of disability according to the appropriate diagnostic codes."
1801535P80S6,,CitationSentence,"See Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355 (2009)."
1801535P80S7,,ReasoningSentence,Evidence concerning the nature and extent of the Veteran's PTSD has been provided by the medical personnel who have examined him at various times during the current appeal and who have rendered pertinent opinions in conjunction with the physical evaluations.
1801535P80S8,,ReasoningSentence,The medical findings as provided in the examination reports directly address the criteria under which this type of disability is evaluated.
1801535P80S9,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board, therefore, finds the medical findings to be of a greater probative value as to the current severity of the Veteran's PTSD than his statements."
1801535P80S10,,FindingSentence,"Given such, the Board does not find that a rating of 70 or 100 percent, as the record stands, is warranted."

1801535P81S3,,Sentence,TDIU
1801535P82S2,,Sentence,A.  Legal Regulations and Principles
1801535P83S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"A total rating for compensation purposes may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more service-connected disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more."
1801535P83S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a)."
1801535P84S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,The term unemployability as used in VA regulations governing total disability ratings is synonymous with an inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation.
1801535P84S3,,CitationSentence,"See VAOPGCPREC 75-91 (Dec. 17, 1991)."
1801535P84S4,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The issue is whether the Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities preclude him from engaging in substantially gainful employment (i.e., work which is more than marginal, that permits the individual to earn a living wage)."
1801535P84S5,,CitationSentence,"See Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991)."
1801535P84S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"In a claim for TDIU, the Board may not reject the claim without producing evidence, as distinguished from mere conjecture, that the Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities do not prevent him from performing work that would produce sufficient income to be other than marginal."
1801535P84S7,,CitationSentence,"Friscia v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 294 (1995)."
1801535P85S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"For a veteran to prevail on a claim for a TDIU, the record must reflect some factor, which takes this case outside the norm."
1801535P85S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,The sole fact that the veteran is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough.
1801535P85S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"A high rating in itself is recognition that impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment, but the ultimate question is whether the veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether the veteran can find employment."
1801535P85S5,,CitationSentence,"Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993)."
1801535P85S6,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Factors to be considered are the veteran's education, employment history, and vocational attainment."
1801535P85S7,,CitationSentence,"See Pederson v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 276, 281 (2015)."
1801535P86S2,,Sentence,B.  Analysis
1801535P87S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran, in his March 2014 VA Form 9, states that he has been unemployed for over six years, which he attributes to his PTSD symptoms, which include panic attacks, difficulty understanding complex material, forgetting to complete tasks, and short and long term memory impairment."
1801535P88S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"In this case, in terms of whether the minimum schedular requirements for TDIU are met, the Veteran's PTSD is evaluated at 50-percent disabling."
1801535P88S3,,FindingSentence,"Here, for the entire period on appeal, because the Veteran's PTSD rating is not 60 percent or higher, the Veteran has not met the schedular requirements."
1801535P88S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"For those veterans who fail to meet the percentage standards set forth in 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(a), total disability ratings for compensation may nevertheless be assigned when it is found that the service-connected disabilities are sufficient to produce unemployability."
1801535P88S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(b).
1801535P88S6,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Although the Board cannot grant a TDIU in the first instance under this regulation, it must still determine whether a remand for referral to the Director of Compensation is warranted."
1801535P88S7,,CitationSentence,"Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 10 (2001)."
1801535P88S8,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, the veteran's service-connected disabilities, employment history, and educational and vocational attainment."
1801535P88S9,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(b).
1801535P89S2,,FindingSentence,"Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that the preponderance of evidence is against a finding that the Veteran is entitled to a TDIU for any time during the appellate period."
1801535P90S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In terms of educational history, the Veteran reported that he graduated from high school in 1967."
1801535P90S3,,CitationSentence,See May 2010 VA examination report.
1801535P90S4,,EvidenceSentence,"In 1970, the Veteran attended ELA Community College and completed a few semesters before he quit."
1801535P91S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In terms of employment history, the Veteran reported that he has not been employed since January 2006."
1801535P91S3,,EvidenceSentence,"His employment history includes working at Pacific telephone company, Southern California Gas Company, Pacific Telephone Company, Southern Pacific Railroad Company, having his own business called Apple Concrete Cutting (which he eventually sold),  and his last employment was with Public Works in the road maintenance department, until he was forced to resign."
1801535P91S4,,CitationSentence,See March 2014 statement by Veteran.
1801535P91S5,,EvidenceSentence,"In regards to his last employment, in the March 2010 VA examination report, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran reported that he was injured on the job and had surgery on his hand."
1801535P92S2,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"In terms of the effect of his PTSD on his ability to obtaining and sustain employment, the Board notes that the May 2010 VA examiner assessed the Veteran with a GAF score of 60, which is indicative of a moderate impairment in social and occupational functioning."
1801535P92S3,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, this evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran's PTSD prevents him from securing or maintaining gainful employment."
1801535P93S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In the Veteran's October 2014 VA DBQ, the VA examiner noted a decrease in the work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation."
1801535P93S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Although the VA examiner also noted that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms cause clinically significant distress on areas including occupational functioning, the VA examiner did not find that there was impairment of occupational functioning, which would prevent him from securing or maintaining gainful employment."
1801535P94S2,,ReasoningSentence,"Therefore, the above reflects that throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's service-connected PTSD has resulted in some and, at times, significant impairment in his ability to work, but there is no indication that his PTSD has prevented him from securing or maintaining gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience."
1801535P95S2,,FindingSentence,"Thus, the Board finds that a preponderance of the evidence suggests that he would not have been prevented from gainful employment."
1801535P95S3,,FindingSentence,"As such, the benefit-of- the-doubt doctrine is not for application."
1801535P95S4,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.102.
1801535P95S5,FindingSentence,LegalRuleSentence,Entitlement to a TDIU must be denied and referral for extraschedular consideration is not warranted.

1801564P10S1,,Sentence,ATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD
1801564P11S2,,Sentence,"A. Diaz-Ferguson, Associate Counsel"
1801564P12S1,,Sentence,INTRODUCTION
1801564P13S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran served on active duty from March 1981 to February 1986.
1801564P14S2,,Sentence,"This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from September 2011 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Winston-Salem, North Carolina."
1801564P14S3,,Sentence,"The RO in Roanoke, Virginia currently holds jurisdiction over this matter."
1801564P15S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In April 2017, the Veteran filed a Motion to Advance on the Docket due to severe financial hardship."
1801564P15S3,,ReasoningSentence,This motion is granted and the appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket.
1801564P15S4,,CitationSentence,See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 7107 (a)(2)  (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 20.900 (c) (2017).
1801564P16S2,,Sentence,The record before the Board consists of electronic records in Virtual VA and the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS).
1801564P17S1,,Sentence,"The issue of entitlement to service connection an acquired psychiatric disorder, claimed as PTSD is addressed in the REMAND portion of the decision below and is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ)."
1801564P18S1,,Sentence,FINDINGS OF FACT
1801564P19S2,,Sentence,1.
1801564P19S3,,Sentence,An April 2005 rating decision denied the claim of entitlement to service
1801564P20S2,,FindingSentence,"connection for a mental disorder, claimed as PTSD; the Veteran did not appeal the decision or submit any pertinent evidence within the appeal period."
1801564P21S2,,Sentence,2.
1801564P21S3,,Sentence,Evidence received subsequent to the expiration of the appeal period includes
1801564P22S2,,FindingSentence,"evidence that is not cumulative or redundant of the evidence previously of record and relates to unestablished facts necessary to substantiate the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, claimed as PTSD."
1801564P23S1,,Sentence,CONCLUSION OF LAW
1801564P24S2,,FindingSentence,"New and material evidence has been presented to reopen the claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, claimed as PTSD."
1801564P24S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5108 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.156 (2017).
1801564P25S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION
1801564P26S2,,Sentence,New and Material Evidence
1801564P27S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Generally, a claim that has been denied in an unappealed RO decision may not thereafter be reopened and allowed."
1801564P27S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 7105(c) (2012).
1801564P27S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"The exception to this rule is 38 U.S.C. Â§ 5108, which provides that if new and material evidence is presented or secured with respect to a claim that has been disallowed, the Secretary shall reopen the claim and review the former disposition of the claim."
1801564P27S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"Moreover, new and material evidence received prior to the expiration of the appeal period, or prior to the appellate decision if a timely appeal has been filed, will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim which was pending at the beginning of the appeal period."
1801564P27S6,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.156 (b) (2017).
1801564P28S2,,LegalRuleSentence,New evidence is defined as existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decision makers.
1801564P28S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Material evidence means evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim."
1801564P28S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"New and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence previously of record, and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim."
1801564P28S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.156 (a).
1801564P29S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has interpreted the language of 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.156(a) as creating a low threshold, and viewed the phrase ""raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim"" as ""enabling rather than precluding reopening."""
1801564P29S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"The Court emphasized that the regulation is designed to be consistent with 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.159(c)(4), which ""does not require new and material evidence as to each previously unproven element of a claim."""
1801564P29S4,,CitationSentence,"Shade v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 110 (2010)."
1801564P30S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"For the purpose of establishing whether new and material evidence has been submitted, the credibility of evidence is presumed unless the evidence is inherently incredible or consists of statements that are beyond the competence of the person or persons making them."
1801564P30S3,,CitationSentence,"See Justus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 513 (1992); Meyer v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 425, 429 (1996); King v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 19, 21 (1993)."
1801564P31S2,Sentence,FindingSentence,"In its April 2005 rating decision, the RO denied the Veteran's claim of service connection for a mental disorder, claimed as PTSD, reasoning the evidence continued to show the condition was not incurred in service as the record did not indicate the Veteran served overseas."
1801564P31S3,,EvidenceSentence,"At the time of the rating decision, the evidence of record consisted of some of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs), and VA treatment records."
1801564P31S4,Sentence,FindingSentence,The Veteran did not appeal the rating decision or submit any pertinent evidence within the appeal period and the rating decision became final.
1801564P32S2,,EvidenceSentence,"When the Veteran submitted a claim to reopen in March 2011, he submitted additional, more recent, VA treatment records."
1801564P32S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Since then, the record has been amended to include the Veteran's complete STRs and military personnel record, and the evidence includes several buddy statements in support of the Veteran's PTSD claim."
1801564P33S1,FindingSentence,ReasoningSentence,"When viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board finds the evidence to be new and material."
1801564P33S2,ReasoningSentence,FindingSentence,"This follows because it is not cumulative or redundant of the evidence previously of record, and it tends to show the Veteran's PTSD may have been caused or be otherwise etiologically related to service."
1801564P33S3,,Sentence,"Accordingly, the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, claimed as PTSD is reopened."
1801564P33S4,,Sentence,This reopened claim will be further addressed in the REMAND section of this decision.
1801564P34S1,,Sentence,ORDER
1801564P35S2,,FindingSentence,"New and material evidence has been received to reopen the claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, claimed as PTSD; to that extent only, the appeal is granted."
1801564P36S1,,Sentence,REMAND
1801564P37S2,,Sentence,"While the Board regrets further delay, additional development is required before the Veteran's claim is adjudicated."
1801564P38S2,,Sentence,"The Veteran claims entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, claimed as PTSD."
1801564P38S3,,EvidenceSentence,"As his in-service stressors, the Veteran has cited multiple incidents."
1801564P38S4,,EvidenceSentence,These included witnessing a fire fight break out with insurgents and having to kill a man while he was in Honduras; holding a baby girl in his arms while she bled to death after a Honduran village was heavily attacked with mortar fire; witnessing a friend being shot in the face while stationed in Honduras; and witnessing a helicopter being shot down and four men burn to death.
1801564P39S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In July 2013, VA determined that the information required to corroborate the stressful events described by the Veteran was insufficient to send to the U. S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) and/or insufficient to allow for meaningful research of Marine Corps or National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) records."
1801564P39S3,,EvidenceSentence,The RO requested further details on some of the stressors from the Veteran and listed the reasons why the stressors could not be verified.
1801564P39S4,,EvidenceSentence,"However, in the last paragraph the RO noted the JSRRC was able to locate ""an unofficial source in which Ft. Bragg officials state that the 426th Signal Battalion, of which the Veteran was a member, was part of about 6000 U.S. troops who would be conducting maneuvers in Honduras and that the unit was deploying during the august 1983 time period."""
1801564P39S5,,Sentence,"The Regional Office adjudicating the claim noted that given this evidence, the PTSD stressor should be conceded."
1801564P40S2,,Sentence,The Board first notes the formal finding was incorrect in stating that JSRRC located the unofficial source.
1801564P40S3,,EvidenceSentence,A review of the record shows it was the defense personnel records information retrieval system (DPRIS) that located the unofficial source and information regarding the deployment of the 426th Signal Battalion.
1801564P40S4,,ReasoningSentence,"In that regard, the Board also notes search queries from June 2013 in which the location searched is ""Turhillo, Honduras."""
1801564P40S5,,Sentence,"This is inaccurate as a simple internet search reveals the correct spelling is ""Trujillo."""
1801564P41S2,,ReasoningSentence,"While the Board recognizes the efforts made by the RO to verify the Veteran's stressors, a remand is warranted for the information to be sent to the JSRRC, and to attempt to verify the claimed stressors through additional channels, to include a search for combat pay, and hostile/imminent danger pay records."
1801564P42S2,,Sentence,On remand all relevant ongoing medical records should be obtained.
1801564P42S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5103A (c) (West 2014); see also Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992) (VA medical records are in constructive possession of the agency, and must be obtained if the material could be determinative of the claim)."
1801564P43S1,,Sentence,"Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:"
1801564P44S2,,CitationSentence,"(Please note, this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. Â§ 20.900(c)."
1801564P44S3,,Sentence,Expedited handling is requested.)
1801564P45S2,,Sentence,1.
1801564P45S3,,EvidenceSentence,Undertake all steps necessary to obtain any additional records to corroborate the Veteran's presence in Honduras between 1983 and 1985.
1801564P45S4,,Sentence,"Specifically, initiate accurate fact-based referrals to the JSRRC and U.S. Army CRC, as well as any other relevant sources, to attempt to verify the alleged stressors."
1801564P45S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, take steps to determine  if the Veteran was in receipt of combat pay, or hostile fire/imminent danger pay during the time period that he alleges he served in Honduras."
1801564P46S2,,Sentence,2.
1801564P46S3,,Sentence,Undertake any other development determined to be warranted.
1801564P47S2,,Sentence,3.
1801564P47S3,,Sentence,"Then, readjudicate the issue on appeal."
1801564P47S4,,ReasoningSentence,"If the benefit sought on appeal is not granted to the Veteran's satisfaction, the Veteran and his representative should be furnished an appropriate supplemental statement of the case and be afforded the requisite opportunity to respond."
1801564P47S5,,Sentence,"Thereafter, the case should be returned to the Board for further appellate action."
1801564P48S2,,Sentence,"By this remand, the board intimates no opinion as to any final outcome warranted."
1801564P49S2,,Sentence,The appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.
1801564P49S3,,CitationSentence,"Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999)."
1801564P50S2,,Sentence,This claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.
1801564P50S3,,Sentence,The law requires that all claims remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.
1801564P50S4,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 5109B, 7112 (West 2014)."

1802756P17S2,,Sentence,"N. T. Werner, Counsel"
1802756P18S1,,Sentence,INTRODUCTION
1802756P19S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Navy from July 1975 to August 1979.
1802756P20S2,,Sentence,"This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from April 2013 and August 2013 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Providence, Rhode Island."
1802756P21S2,,Sentence,In December 2016 the Board remanded the above issues for further development.
1802756P22S2,,Sentence,"In this regard, in a May 2017 rating decision the RO granted service connection for bilateral hearing loss."
1802756P22S3,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, the Board finds that this issue is no longer in appellate status."
1802756P23S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Subsequently an October 2017 rating decision recharacterized the Veteran's PTSD as including his alcohol use disorder and granted him a 70 percent rating effective from May 17, 2016."
1802756P23S3,,ReasoningSentence,Therefore the Board has recharacterized this issue as it appears above.

1802756P34S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
1802756P35S2,,Sentence,The Service Connection Claims
1802756P36S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran asserts that his bilateral hip and neck disabilities are due to his military service and/or his service-connected low back disability.
1802756P36S3,,CitationSentence,"See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015)."
1802756P36S4,,EvidenceSentence,"As to his neck, he claims he sustained an injury while helping to load torpedoes on his submarine and this caused his current neck disability."
1802756P36S5,,EvidenceSentence,He also claims he injured his neck working lines and pulleys as well as bowling while on active duty.
1802756P37S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby."
1802756P37S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1131; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303.
1802756P37S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"If a condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, then generally a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required for service connection if the disability is one that is listed in 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.309."
1802756P37S5,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(b); see also Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013)."
1802756P37S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"In addition, service connection may also be granted on the basis of a post-service initial diagnosis of a disease, where the physician relates the current condition to the period of service."
1802756P37S7,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(d).
1802756P37S8,,LegalRuleSentence,"Other specifically enumerated disorders, including arthritis, will be presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within the first year following separation from active duty."
1802756P37S9,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1101, 1112, 1113 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.307, 3.309 (2017)."
1802756P38S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In this regard, in order to establish service connection for the claimed disorders, there must be (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability."
1802756P38S3,,CitationSentence,"See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999)."
1802756P39S2,,LegalRuleSentence,Service connection may also be granted where disability is proximately due to or the result of already service-connected disability.
1802756P39S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.310.
1802756P39S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,Compensation is payable when service-connected disability has aggravated a non-service-connected disorder.
1802756P39S5,,CitationSentence,"Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc)."
1802756P40S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"The requirement of a current disability is ""satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim."""
1802756P40S3,,CitationSentence,"See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007)."
1802756P41S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant."
1802756P41S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5107; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990)."
1802756P42S2,,LegalRuleSentence,In evaluating the evidence the Board has been charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence.
1802756P42S3,,CitationSentence,"Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F. 3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007)."
1802756P42S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Indeed, the Court has declared that in adjudicating a claim, the Board has the responsibility to do so."
1802756P42S5,,CitationSentence,"Bryan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 482, 488-89 (2000)."
1802756P42S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"In doing so, the Board is free to favor one medical opinion over another, provided it offers an adequate basis for doing so."
1802756P42S7,,CitationSentence,"Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995)."
1802756P43S2,,EvidenceSentence,The post-service records show the Veteran being diagnosed with bilateral hip and neck arthritis.
1802756P43S3,,CitationSentence,"See, e.g., cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging evaluation (MRI) dated in December 2015; VA examinations dated in March 2017."
1802756P43S4,,ReasoningSentence,"Moreover, the Board finds that the Veteran is competent to report on the objective manifestations of these disabilities, such as pain and lost motion, because it comes to him via his own senses."
1802756P43S5,,CitationSentence,See Davidson.
1802756P43S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Further, service treatment records reflect complaints regarding the neck on occasion."
1802756P43S7,CitationSentence,EvidenceSentence,See service treatment records dated in August 1976 and January 1978.
1802756P43S8,,EvidenceSentence,"Lastly, the record shows he served on a submarine."
1802756P44S2,,EvidenceSentence,"However except for the above isolated complaint of a neck problem without a diagnosis, service treatment records including the July 1979 separation examination, are negative for injuries, symptoms, treatment, or a diagnosis of hip and/or neck disabilities."
1802756P44S3,,EvidenceSentence,"In fact, at the July 1979 examination the Veteran did not report a history, symptoms, and/or diagnoses of hip and/or neck injury or disabilities and examination of his neck and lower extremities was normal."
1802756P44S4,,ReasoningSentence,These medical opinions are not contradicted by any other medical evidence of record.
1802756P44S5,,CitationSentence,"See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(a); Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991) (VA may only consider independent medical evidence to support its findings and is not permitted to base decisions on its own unsubstantiated medical conclusions)."
1802756P45S2,,EvidenceSentence,The record also does not show the Veteran being diagnosed with either disability in the first post-service year.
1802756P45S3,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.307, 3.309."
1802756P46S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Similarly, the record does not show that the Veteran had a continued problem with bilateral hip and/or neck disabilities in and since service."
1802756P46S3,,EvidenceSentence,"In fact, as reported above, the July 1979 separation examination is negative for complaints, diagnoses, or treatment for hip disabilities and negative for a neck disability."
1802756P46S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Likewise the post-service records, including a June 1980 VA examination, are negative for a history, complaints, and/or a diagnosis of hip disabilities until approximately 2014 (see, e.g., VA treatment record dated in August 2014) and a neck disability until approximately 2004 (see, e.g., VA treatment records dated in September 2004; VA examination dated in March 2014 (parenthetically, the Board notes that while the March 2014 VA examiner reported that the Veteran's cervical spine disability pre-dated his September 2004 VA hospitalization, VA treatment records are negative for earlier cervical spine complaints, diagnoses, or treatment))."
1802756P46S5,,EvidenceSentence,"In fact, at the June 1980 examination the Veteran did not report a history, symptoms, and/or diagnoses of hip and/or neck injury or disabilities and examination of his neck was normal and the examiner opined that the examination did not disclose any abnormalities."
1802756P46S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Similarly, when examined in connection with a VA hospitalization in August 1999, the Veteran had no musculoskeletal, including the neck, complaints."
1802756P47S2,,FindingSentence,"Furthermore, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's bilateral hip and neck disabilities are not due to his military service."
1802756P47S3,,CitationSentence,"See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(d); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143 (1992) (establishing service connection requires finding a relationship between a current disability and events in service or an injury or disease incurred therein)."
1802756P47S4,,ReasoningSentence,"In this regard, the May 2013 and March 2017 VA examinations as well as the August 2017 addendum include opinions that that neither neck and/or bilateral hip disabilities were due to the Veteran's military service based on a review of the record on appeal and an examination of the Veteran and these opinions are supported by citation to medical evidence found in the claims file and/or controlling medical literature."
1802756P47S5,,ReasoningSentence,"Tellingly, these opinions are not contradicted by any other medical evidence of record."
1802756P47S6,,CitationSentence,"See Colvin; Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995) (holding that VA may favor the opinion of one competent medical expert over that of another when decision makers give an adequate statement of reasons and bases)."
1802756P48S2,,FindingSentence,"Lastly, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's post-service bilateral hip and neck disabilities are not caused or aggravated by his service-connected low back disability."
1802756P48S3,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.310; Allen.
1802756P48S4,,EvidenceSentence,"In fact, the May 2013 and March 2017 VA examinations as well as the August 2017 addendum also include opinions that neither the neck and/or bilateral hip disabilities were caused or aggravated by his service-connected low back disabilities based on a review of the record on appeal and an examination of the Veteran and these opinions are supported by citation to medical evidence found in the claims file and/or controlling medical literature."
1802756P48S5,,ReasoningSentence,These opinions are also not contradicted by any other medical evidence of record.
1802756P48S6,,CitationSentence,See Colvin; Owens.
1802756P49S2,ReasoningSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"As to direct and secondary service connection, the Board also finds that the Veteran and other lay persons are not competent to provide nexus opinions because they do not have the required medical expertise to provide answers to these complex medical questions."
1802756P49S3,,CitationSentence,See Davidson.
1802756P50S2,,FindingSentence,"Accordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claims of service connection bilateral hip and neck disabilities and the claims are denied on a direct and secondary basis."
1802756P50S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131; 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.303, 3.310."
1802756P51S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"In reaching all the above conclusions, the Board also considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt."
1802756P51S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5107(b).
1802756P51S4,,FindingSentence,"However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the claims, the doctrine is not for application."
1802756P51S5,,CitationSentence,"See also, e.g., Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert."
1802756P52S2,,Sentence,The Rating Claim
1802756P53S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran contends that his PTSD and alcohol use disorder is worse than rated and warrants higher evaluations.
1802756P53S3,,CitationSentence,See Scott.
1802756P54S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based, as far as can practically be determined, on the average impairment of earning capacity."
1802756P54S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.1.
1802756P54S4,LegalRuleSentence,FindingSentence,Each service-connected disability is rated on the basis of specific criteria identified by Diagnostic Codes.
1802756P54S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.27.
1802756P54S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"When rating the Veteran's service-connected disability, the entire medical history must be borne in mind."
1802756P54S7,,CitationSentence,"Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991)."
1802756P54S8,,LegalRuleSentence,"Separate higher or lower compensable evaluations may be assigned for separate periods of time if such distinct periods are shown by the competent evidence of record during the appeal, a practice known as ""staged"" ratings."
1802756P54S9,,CitationSentence,"See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999)."
1802756P55S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Regulations require that where there is a question as to which of two evaluations is to be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating."
1802756P55S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned."
1802756P55S4,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.7.
1802756P56S2,EvidenceSentence,CitationSentence,"The Veteran's PTSD and alcohol use disorder is rated as 30 percent disabling from January 13, 2013, and 70 percent disabling from May 17, 2016, under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411 (the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula))."
1802756P57S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"This regulation provides a 30 percent rating when the evidence shows occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events)."
1802756P57S3,,CitationSentence,Id.
1802756P58S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A 50 percent rating is warranted when the evidence shows occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships."
1802756P58S3,,CitationSentence,Id.
1802756P59S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A 70 percent rating is warranted when the evidence shows occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships."
1802756P59S3,,CitationSentence,Id.
1802756P60S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A 100 percent rating is warranted when the evidence shows total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name."
1802756P60S3,,CitationSentence,Id.
1802756P61S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,Ratings are assigned according to the manifestation of particular symptoms.
1802756P61S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"However, the use of the term ""such as"" in 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130 demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather are to serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating."
1802756P61S4,,CitationSentence,"Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002)."
1802756P61S5,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"When determining the appropriate disability evaluation to assign, however, the Board's ""primary consideration"" is the Veteran's symptoms."
1802756P61S6,,CitationSentence,"Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 118 (Fed. Cir. 2013)."
1802756P62S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale, with scores ranging between zero and 100 percent, represents the psychological, social, and occupational functioning of an individual on a hypothetical continuum of mental health-illness."
1802756P62S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"GAF scores included in the record are a scale reflecting the psychological, social, and occupational functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental health-illness."
1802756P62S4,,CitationSentence,"Carpenter v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 240, 242 (1995)."
1802756P63S1,,Sentence,"In this regard, the Board acknowledges that effective August 4, 2014, VA amended the regulations regarding the evaluation of mental disorders by removing outdated references to DSM-IV, AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION:  DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS, 4th Edition (1994)."
1802756P63S2,,Sentence,"The amendments replace those references with references to the recently updated DSM-5, and examinations conducted pursuant to the DSM-5 do not include GAF scores."
1802756P63S3,,ReasoningSentence,"Although the Veteran's case was certified post-DSM-5, most of his evaluations were conducted prior to that time and therefore include a relevant GAF score."
1802756P63S4,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board will consider these GAF scores in adjudicating the claim, as doing so is most advantageous to the Veteran in this case."
1802756P64S2,,EvidenceSentence,The record on appeal shows that the Veteran has a history of hospitalizations because of suicidal ideation.
1802756P64S3,,CitationSentence,"See, e.g., VA treatment records dated in August 1999; Rhode Island Hospital treatment records dated in February 2002."
1802756P64S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The record also Veteran's PTSD has been productive of symptoms such as a depressed mood, anxiety, sleep impairment, mild memory loss, as well as disturbances of motivation and mood at the May 2013 VA examination; an anxious/distressed mood in VA treatment records (see VA treatment records dated in August 2014 and September 2014); as well as a depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, and disturbances of motivation and mood at the March 2017 VA examination."
1802756P64S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Furthermore, the record shows and/or the Veteran told the March 2017 VA examiner that he has not worked since 2009, he divorced in 2003 after only five years of marriage, he lives in his mother's and uncle's basement, he has not been involved in any romantic relationship in over ten years, he has no friends, and he does not get out due to his anxiety."
1802756P65S2,,ReasoningSentence,"Initially, the Board finds that the Veteran's should not be penalized by the fact that the RO waited almost four years to provide him with another VA examination after his May 2013 VA examination."
1802756P65S3,,CitationSentence,"See Tatum v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 139, 145 (2010) (holding that it is ""the information in a medical opinion, and not the date the medical opinion was provided that is relevant when assigning an effective date"")."
1802756P65S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Moreover, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that suicidal ideation generally rises to the level contemplated in a 70 percent evaluation."
1802756P65S5,,CitationSentence,"See Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 19 (2017) (stating the language of 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130 ""indicates that the presence of suicidal ideation alone, that is, a veteran's thoughts of his or her own death or thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior, may cause occupational and social impairment in most areas."")."
1802756P65S6,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, when considering the frequency, severity, and duration of the Veteran's impairment to assess his disability picture and when resolving all reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that the evidence shows that the appellant's PTSD and alcohol use disorder has approximated the criteria for a 70 percent rating for the entire appeal period."
1802756P65S7,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130; Fenderson.
1802756P66S2,,FindingSentence,"However, the Board finds that the criteria for a higher rating of 100 percent are not met."
1802756P66S3,FindingSentence,ReasoningSentence,"In this regard, the Board finds that that the most probative evidence of record does not show his PTSD and alcohol use disorder causes total social and occupational impairment despite the fact that it shows he has not worked since 2009; he divorced from his wife after only five years of marriage in 2003, and he lives in his mother's and uncle's basement."
1802756P66S4,,CitationSentence,"See, e.g., VA examinations dated in May 2013 and March 2017."
1802756P66S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Tellingly, nothing in the record shows that the Veteran's stopped working in 2010 solely due to his service-connected PTSD and alcohol use disorder."
1802756P66S6,,EvidenceSentence,"In fact, it appears from his statements to the March 2017 VA examiner that his low back disability played as much as a role as his PTSD and alcohol use disorder for his stopping to work."
1802756P66S7,,EvidenceSentence,"Likewise, while the record shows the Veteran is socially isolated, he also told the March 2017 examiner that he gets along ""fairly well"" with his mother, he regularly sees his father, is in contact with one of his four siblings and they have am okay relationship."
1802756P66S8,,ReasoningSentence,"Moreover, while the Veteran has some memory loss, there is no evidence of memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name."
1802756P66S9,,ReasoningSentence,"Similarly, the Board finds that there is also no evidence in the record of persistent delusions, hallucinations, gross impairment in thought processes/communication, or of disorientation to time or place."
1802756P66S10,,EvidenceSentence,Grossly inappropriate behavior as well as an inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene) has also not been shown.
1802756P66S11,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, while he had suicidal ideation with a gesture, the record is negative for a plan or any evidence that he is a persistent danger of hurting others."
1802756P67S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In this regard, at the May 2013 VA examination the examiner did not report that the Veteran's adverse symptomatology included panic attacks; flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped, intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impaired judgment or abstract thinking; gross impairment in thought processes or communication; obsessional rituals; impaired impulse control; spatial disorientation; delusions; hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting others; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; an inability to perform activities of daily living; and disorientation to time or place."
1802756P67S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Similarly, at the March 2017 VA examination it was opined that the Veteran was casually dressed and appropriately groomed; he was oriented in all three spheres; he was pleasant, cooperative, and maintained good eye contact; his affect was appropriate; his thought process was linear; and there was no evidence of psychosis;"
1802756P68S2,,FindingSentence,"Accordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence shows that the Veteran's PTSD and alcohol use disorder is not manifested by symptomatology that causes total occupational and social impairment at any time during the pendency of the appeal."
1802756P68S3,,CitationSentence,See Owens.
1802756P68S4,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, the Board finds that the criteria for a 100 percent rating are not met for the Veteran's PTSD and alcohol use disorder at any period during the appeal."
1802756P68S5,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130; Fenderson.
1802756P69S1,,Sentence,ORDER
1802756P70S2,,Sentence,Service connection for a bilateral hip disability is denied.
1802756P71S2,,Sentence,Service connection for a neck disability is denied.
1802756P72S2,,Sentence,"From January 13, 2013, an initial 70 percent rating for PTSD and alcohol use disorder, but no higher, is granted subject to the applicable laws and regulations governing the payment of monetary benefits."
1802756P73S1,,Sentence,REMAND
1802756P74S2,,ReasoningSentence,"As to the claim for higher evaluations for a low back disability, the Board finds that none of the existing VA examinations included range of motion testing in both active and passive motion, weight-bearing, and non-weight-bearing situations as well as opinions as to the Veteran's range of motion during flare-ups."
1802756P74S3,,CitationSentence,"See Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017)."
1802756P74S4,,ReasoningSentence,"As such, the Board finds that another remand is necessary to provide the Veteran with a new VA examination to conduct the appropriate range of motion testing."
1802756P74S5,,CitationSentence,See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5103A(d) (West 2014).
1802756P75S2,,ReasoningSentence,"As to the claim for a TDIU prior to January 13, 2013, the Board finds that this issue must also be remanded because its adjudication is inextricably intertwined with the above issue."
1802756P75S3,,CitationSentence,"See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (where a claim is inextricably intertwined with another claim, the claims must be adjudicated together in order to enter a final decision on the matter)."
1802756P76S1,,EvidenceSentence,"Accordingly, these issues are REMANDED to the AOJ for the following actions:"
1802756P77S2,,Sentence,1.
1802756P77S3,,EvidenceSentence,"After obtaining authorizations from the Veteran, associate with the claims file any outstanding private treatment records."
1802756P78S2,,Sentence,2.
1802756P78S3,,EvidenceSentence,Associate with the claims file all of the Veteran's post-January 2017 treatment records from the Providence VA Medical Center.
1802756P79S2,,Sentence,3.
1802756P79S3,,ReasoningSentence,"Notify the Veteran and his representative that they can submit lay statements from the claimant and from other individuals who have first-hand knowledge of the problems caused by his low back disability to include all problems with employment prior to January 13, 2013."
1802756P79S4,,Sentence,Provide them a reasonable time to submit this evidence.
1802756P80S2,,Sentence,4.
1802756P80S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Schedule the Veteran for appropriate VA examinations to determine the nature and severity of his low back disability from September 19, 2011."
1802756P80S4,,EvidenceSentence,The claims file should be made available to and reviewed by the examiner and all necessary tests should be performed.
1802756P80S5,,Sentence,All findings should be reported in detail.
1802756P81S2,,Sentence,A. Range of Motion Studies:
1802756P82S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner should identify all low back pathology found to be present since September 19, 2011."
1802756P83S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner should conduct all indicated tests and studies, to include range of motion studies."
1802756P83S3,,Sentence,Full range of motion testing must be performed where possible.
1802756P83S4,,Sentence,"The joints involved should be tested in both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non weight-bearing."
1802756P83S5,,EvidenceSentence,"If the examiner is unable to conduct the required testing or concludes that the required testing is not necessary in this case, he or she should clearly explain why that is so."
1802756P84S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner should describe any pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, instability of station and incoordination present."
1802756P85S2,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner should also state whether the examination is taking place during a period of flare-up.
1802756P85S3,,EvidenceSentence,"If not, the examiner should ask the Veteran to describe the flare-ups he experiences, including: frequency, duration, characteristics, precipitating and alleviating factors, severity and/or extent of functional impairment he experiences during a flare-up of symptoms and/or after repeated use over time."
1802756P86S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Based on the Veteran's lay statements and the other evidence of record, the examiner should provide an opinion estimating any additional degrees of limited motion caused by functional loss during a flare-up and after repeated use over time."
1802756P87S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"If the examiner cannot estimate the degrees of additional range of motion loss during flare-ups and/or after repetitive use without resorting to speculation, the examiner should state whether the need to speculate is caused by a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (i.e."
1802756P87S3,,EvidenceSentence,no one could respond given medical science and the known facts) or by a deficiency in the record or the examiner (i.e.
1802756P87S4,,EvidenceSentence,"additional facts are required, or the examiner does not have the needed knowledge or training)."
1802756P88S2,,Sentence,B. Other Findings:
1802756P89S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner should state whether the low back disability is productive of any incapacitating episodes, which are defined as periods of acute signs and symptoms that require bed rest prescribed by a physician or treatment by a physician, and if so, the frequency and duration."
1802756P90S2,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner should also state whether the low back disability is productive of any bowel or bladder problems.
1802756P91S2,,Sentence,5.
1802756P91S3,,Sentence,Then adjudicate the appeal.
1802756P91S4,,Sentence,"If any benefit sought on appeal is not granted in full, furnish the Veteran a supplemental statement of the case (SSOC)."
1802756P91S5,,Sentence,The Veteran should be given an appropriate opportunity for response before returning the appeal to the Board.
1802756P92S2,,Sentence,The appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.
1802756P92S3,,CitationSentence,"Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999)."
1802756P93S2,,ReasoningSentence,These claims must be afforded expeditious treatment.
1802756P93S3,,LegalRuleSentence,The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

1802857P23S1,,Sentence,FINDING OF FACT
1802857P24S2,,FindingSentence,The Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD related to his active duty service.
1802857P25S1,,Sentence,CONCLUSION OF LAW
1802857P26S2,,FindingSentence,The criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met.
1802857P26S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1110, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304(f) (2017)."
1802857P27S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION
1802857P28S2,,Sentence,"The Veteran seeks service connection for PTSD, which he asserts was caused by in-service trauma."
1802857P28S3,,LegalRuleSentence,Service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD in accordance with criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.
1802857P28S4,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f); see also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997)."
1802857P29S2,,Sentence,
1802857P30S2,,LegalRuleSentence,A veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor in certain circumstances.
1802857P30S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"These circumstances include when (1) the evidence establishes a diagnosis of PTSD during service and the claimed stressor is related to that service and consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service; (2) the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the stressor is related to that combat and consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service; (3) the stressor claimed by the veteran is related to the veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, provided that the stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service; and, (4) the evidence establishes that the veteran was a prisoner-of-war and the claimed stressor is related to that prisoner-of-war experience and is consistent with the circumstances, condition, or hardships of the veteran's service."
1802857P30S4,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f)(1)-(4).
1802857P30S5,,LegalRuleSentence,The lay testimony can be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
1802857P30S6,,CitationSentence,Id.
1802857P31S2,,Sentence,
1802857P32S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Where the claimed stressor is not related to combat, a veteran's lay testimony alone will not be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor."
1802857P32S3,,CitationSentence,"See Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395 (1996); see also Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 (1996)."
1802857P32S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"In such cases, the record must contain service records or other corroborative evidence which substantiates or verifies the veteran's testimony or statements as to the occurrence of the claimed stressor."
1802857P32S5,,CitationSentence,"See West (Carlton) v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70, 76 (1994); see also Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1993)."
1802857P32S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"Moreover, a medical opinion diagnosing PTSD does not suffice to verify the occurrence of a claimed in-service stressor."
1802857P32S7,,CitationSentence,"See Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at 395; see also Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 142."
1802857P33S2,,Sentence,
1802857P34S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran asserts that he has PTSD due to his service in Okinawa, Japan as a Riot Control Officer and his experiences unloading combat damaged vehicles from the Republic of Vietnam."
1802857P34S3,,EvidenceSentence,During the January 2017 Board hearing the Veteran described his stressor incidents.
1802857P34S4,,EvidenceSentence,He testified that while he was stationed in Okinawa from October 1968 to May 1970 he witnessed several riots take place.
1802857P34S5,,EvidenceSentence,"He described incidents where rioters would attempt to enter the loading docks where he worked; that rioters threw bricks, rocks and bottles, and on one occasion he was struck in the face."
1802857P34S6,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran testified that he had seen people pulled from their cars and the cars set on fire and turned over.
1802857P34S7,,EvidenceSentence,"He described an occasion when he was driving with his family and another service member's family when rioters surrounded, stopped his car, and struck his car."
1802857P34S8,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's wife testified to her recollection of the event as a passenger in the car.
1802857P34S9,,EvidenceSentence,She testified that during the Veteran's Okinawa service she remembered the Veteran coming home with bruises and blood on his body.
1802857P34S10,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran testified that he experiences nightmares due to his service in Okinawa.
1802857P34S11,,EvidenceSentence,"Service records establish that the Veteran served with the 412th Transportation Company in Okinawa, Japan beginning in October 1968."
1802857P34S12,,EvidenceSentence,"A July 1969 disposition form reflects that the Veteran requested that his wife, who was with him in Okinawa at the time, be given a permanent residence visa."
1802857P34S13,,EvidenceSentence,A response from the Defense Personnel Records Information Retrieval System (DPRIS) indicates that unit records from the 412th Transportation Company from 1968 to 1970 could not be located.
1802857P35S2,,Sentence,
1802857P36S2,,EvidenceSentence,In his statements in support of service connection for PTSD the Veteran asserted that he was assigned riot control duty several times during his service in Okinawa and that he was subjected to hand-to-hand combat with rioters.
1802857P36S3,,EvidenceSentence,He reported that he sustained a minor injury to his nose and witnessed a woman and two children who were dragged from their car and the car was set on fire.
1802857P36S4,,EvidenceSentence,He reported that he continues to experience flashbacks from these events.
1802857P36S5,,EvidenceSentence,He also reported that when combat damaged vehicles would arrive from Vietnam he would find human remains in the vehicles.
1802857P37S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Statements submitted by and on behalf of the Veteran, including statements from other servicemen with the 412th Transportation Company, describe riots that took place in Okinawa during the time period that the Veteran was stationed there."
1802857P37S3,,EvidenceSentence,The lay statements reflect that riots frequently occurred at the ports and that riot control units comprised of service members were often called in to disperse the crowd.
1802857P37S4,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"They asserted that the rioters would often throw bricks, rocks, bottles and Molotov cocktails."
1802857P37S5,,Sentence,In September 2013 the RO made a formal finding of a lack of information required to corroborate stressors associated with the Veteran's service connection claim for PTSD.
1802857P38S2,,Sentence,
1802857P39S2,,FindingSentence,"Upon review, the Board finds that the Veteran has consistently and credibly reported the details of his alleged in-service stressor, and there is sufficient credible, supporting documentation for the Veteran's assertions that the Veteran experienced the described riots in Okinawa, Japan during active duty."
1802857P40S2,,Sentence,
1802857P41S2,,EvidenceSentence,VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran undergoes treatment for his PTSD symptoms.
1802857P41S3,,EvidenceSentence,Treatment providers reported the Veteran's service in Okinawa on riot control and that the Veteran reported seeing upsetting incidents.
1802857P41S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran reported that he did not previously seek help because he was concerned he would be labelled as crazy, but that since retirement he has had increased difficulty falling asleep due to his nightmares."
1802857P41S5,,EvidenceSentence,He reported that his nightmares are related to his service in Okinawa and the riots.
1802857P41S6,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's treatment provider recorded the Veteran endorsed PTSD symptoms of nightmares every night and symptoms of depression.
1802857P42S2,,EvidenceSentence,In August 2013 the Veteran underwent a VA mental health examination.
1802857P42S3,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner diagnosed PTSD.
1802857P42S4,,EvidenceSentence,"He reported that the Veteran began having issues with anxiety, depression, insomnia, flashbacks, nightmares, and irritability after service."
1802857P42S5,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner recorded two stressors.
1802857P42S6,,EvidenceSentence,"He reported that witnessing riots in Okinawa, including seeing American civilians pulled from their vehicles and being beaten met Criterion A to support a PTSD diagnosis and was related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity."
1802857P42S7,,EvidenceSentence,"He also reported that the Veteran's experience cleaning out ships with vehicles from Vietnam that frequently contained human remains met Criterion A to support a PTSD diagnosis, but was not related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity."
1802857P42S8,,EvidenceSentence,He reported that both stressors contributed to the Veteran's diagnosis of PTSD.
1802857P42S9,,EvidenceSentence,A February 2015 disability benefits questionnaire also reflects the Veteran's PTSD diagnosis and ongoing treatment.
1802857P43S2,,Sentence,
1802857P44S2,ReasoningSentence,FindingSentence,There is no conflicting medical evidence pertaining to the question of whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD related to the claimed in-service stressor.
1802857P44S3,,EvidenceSentence,"As noted, the testimony and the statements submitted in support of the Veteran's claim consistently and credibly reported the details of his alleged in-service stressor."
1802857P44S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Notably, the Veteran's wife testified that she witnessed the circumstances of the same stressor that the August 2013 VA examiner reported demonstrated evidence of hostile military or terrorist activity to support a diagnosis of PTSD."
1802857P44S5,,FindingSentence,"In summary, the probative evidence of record shows a verified in-service stressor, medical evidence diagnosing PTSD based on that stressor, and a link between the Veteran's current symptoms of PTSD and the in-service stressor."
1802857P44S6,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, service connection for PTSD is warranted."
1802857P44S7,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.102; see also Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53."
1802857P45S2,,Sentence,
1802857P46S1,,Sentence,ORDER
1802857P47S2,,Sentence,Service connection for PTSD is granted.

1803013P30S2,,Sentence,I. Legal Criteria
1803013P31S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a link between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability."
1803013P31S3,,CitationSentence,"Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013)."
1803013P31S4,,LegalRuleSentence,Secondary service connection will be granted if a disability is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury.
1803013P31S5,,CitationSentence,"See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.310(a)-(b)."
1803013P31S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"With respect to aggravation, ""[a]ny increase in severity of a nonservice-connected disease or injury that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury, and not due to the natural progress of the nonservice-connected disease, will be service connected."""
1803013P31S7,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.310(b).
1803013P32S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Once service connection has been granted, disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings that are based on average impairment of earning capacity."
1803013P32S3,,CitationSentence,See 38 U.S.C. Â§ 1155; Part 4.
1803013P32S4,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities, and disabilities must be reviewed in relation to their history."
1803013P32S5,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.1.
1803013P32S6,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"Pertinent general policy considerations include: interpreting examination reports in light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability, resolving any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability in favor of the claimant, evaluating functional impairment on the basis of lack of usefulness, and evaluating the effects of the disability upon the veteran's ordinary activity."
1803013P32S7,,CitationSentence,"See 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.2, 4.3, 4.10; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991)."
1803013P32S8,,Sentence,This analysis is undertaken with consideration of the possibility that different ratings may be warranted for different periods.

1803013P33S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Where the issue is the initial disability evaluation assigned, VA must consider the medical evidence since the effective date of service connection, as well as whether staged ratings are appropriate."

1803013P33S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"Further, ""[w]here there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating."
1803013P33S5,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned."""

1803013P35S1,LegalRuleSentence,CitationSentence,"Acquired psychiatric disabilities are evaluated under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130, with PTSD evaluated under Diagnostic Code 9411."
1803013P35S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Under that diagnostic code, a 50 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity."
1803013P35S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"This may be due to such symptoms such as, for example: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short-and long-term memory (e.g. retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing effective work and social relationships."
1803013P35S4,,CitationSentence,See id.
1803013P36S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A 70 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas (such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and mood)."
1803013P36S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"This may be due to such symptoms such as, for example: suicidal ideations; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); and the inability to establish and maintain effective relationships."
1803013P36S4,,CitationSentence,See id.
1803013P36S5,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,A 100 percent rating is warranted if there is total occupational and social impairment.
1803013P36S6,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"This may be due to such symptoms such as, for example: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; gross inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name."

1803013P37S6,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"When evaluating a mental disorder, the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission must be considered."
1803013P37S7,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.126.
1803013P37S8,,LegalRuleSentence,"The use of the term ""such as"" in 38 C.F.R.

1803013P37S9,,CitationSentence,"See Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 436."
1803013P37S10,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"Further, the evaluation must be based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment rather than solely on an examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of an examination."
1803013P37S11,,CitationSentence,See id.
1803013P38S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,Psychiatric examinations frequently include assignment of a Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score.
1803013P38S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The GAF is a scale which reflects the ""psychological, social, and occupational functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental health-illness."""
1803013P38S4,CitationSentence,Sentence,"See American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)."
1803013P38S5,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"The Board notes that the GAF scale was removed from the more recent DSM-5 for several reasons, including its conceptual lack of clarity, and questionable psychometrics in routine practice."
1803013P38S6,CitationSentence,Sentence,"See DSM-5, Introduction, The Multiaxial System (2013)."
1803013P38S7,,ReasoningSentence,"Still, the GAF score and interpretations of the score are important considerations in the rating of a psychiatric disability, though the GAF score assigned to a veteran is not dispositive of the severity of the veteran's mental health disability."
1803013P38S8,,CitationSentence,"See Richard v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 266, 267 (1996); Carpenter v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 240 (1995)."
1803013P38S9,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"The GAF score must be considered in light of the actual symptoms manifested by the veteran's disorder, which must provide the primary basis for the rating assigned."
1803013P38S10,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.126(a).
1803013P39S2,,EvidenceSentence,"According to the pertinent sections of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (1994) (DSM-IV), a GAF score of 71 to 80 indicates that if symptoms are present, they are transient and expectable reactions to psychosocial stressors, and that the examinee suffers no more than slight impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning."
1803013P39S3,,EvidenceSentence,"A GAF score of 61 to 70 indicates some mild symptoms, or that the examinee suffers from some difficulty with social, occupational, or school functioning, but that the examinee generally functions well and has some meaningful interpersonal relationships."
1803013P39S4,,EvidenceSentence,"A GAF score of 51 to 60 indicates the examinee has moderate symptoms or moderate difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning."
1803013P39S5,,EvidenceSentence,"A GAF score of 41 to 50 indicates the examinee has serious symptoms or a serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning."

1803013P119S2,,EvidenceSentence,The puretone threshold average (ignoring 500 hertz) was 50 in the left ear and 45 in the right ear.
1803013P119S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran received a speech recognition score of 78 percent in the left ear and 72 percent in the right ear.
1803013P119S4,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Under Table VI, these test results show that the Veteran suffered from Level IV hearing impairment in both ears."
1803013P119S5,ReasoningSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"These values, when analyzed under Table VII, equate to a disability rating of 10 percent."
1803013P119S6,,EvidenceSentence,"The examination report containing these results noted that the Veteran reported watching television with an increased volume, as well as using closed captioning."
1803013P119S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran also reported that he has to ""to look at people to concentrate [on] what they are saying[.]"""
1803013P120S2,,FindingSentence,"Based upon the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran suffered from no worse than Level IV hearing impairment in both ears during the period on appeal."
1803013P120S3,,FindingSentence,A rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability is not warranted for any point during the appeal period.
1803013P120S4,,FindingSentence,A rating of 10 percent is not warranted for the period on appeal prior to December 2015.
1803013P121S2,,ReasoningSentence,The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements that his hearing loss and PTSD disabilities are worse than currently evaluated.
1803013P121S3,,ReasoningSentence,The Veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses.
1803013P121S4,,CitationSentence,"Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994)."
1803013P121S5,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"He is not, however, competent to identify a specific level of disability of this disorder according to the appropriate diagnostic codes."
1803013P121S6,,ReasoningSentence,Such competent evidence concerning the nature and extent of the Veteran's disabilities has been provided by the medical personnel who have examined him during the current appeal and who have rendered pertinent opinions in conjunction with the evaluations.
1803013P121S7,,ReasoningSentence,The medical findings (as provided in the examination reports and the clinical records) directly address the criteria under which this disability is evaluated.
1803013P121S8,,ReasoningSentence,"As such, the Board finds these records to be more probative than the Veteran's subjective complaints of increased symptomatology."

1803547P13S1,,Sentence,INTRODUCTION
1803547P14S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran served on active duty from September 1989 to June 1998.
1803547P15S2,,Sentence,"This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2010 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Atlanta, Georgia."
1803547P16S2,,FindingSentence,"As the scope of the Veteran's claim of service connection for depression encompasses other psychiatric disorders that have been raised by the record, such as PTSD, the Board has recharacterized the issue on appeal as reflected on the title page."
1803547P16S3,,CitationSentence,"See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009)."
1803547P16S4,,Sentence,"To this end, the Veteran initially filed a claim and perfected an appeal for service connection for MDD."

1803547P23S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
1803547P24S2,,Sentence,I. Psychiatric Disorder
1803547P25S2,,Sentence,"The Veteran is seeking service connection for a psychiatric disorder, specifically PTSD and MDD."
1803547P25S3,,EvidenceSentence,Her claimed stressor is one of personal assault; she was the victim of spousal abuse during active duty.
1803547P26S2,,LegalRuleSentence,Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.
1803547P26S3,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303."
1803547P26S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: ""(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service""-the so-called 'nexus' requirement."""
1803547P26S5,,CitationSentence,"Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004))."
1803547P27S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"To establish service connection for PTSD generally, a veteran must show: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125(a) (conforming to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM); (2) medical evidence establishing a link between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred."
1803547P27S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f).
1803547P28S2,,FindingSentence,"On review, the preponderance of the evidence shows that the Veteran's psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and MDD, is directly related to a personal assault in service."
1803547P29S2,,FindingSentence,"First, a diagnosis of PTSD that conforms to the DSM-5 criteria is established."
1803547P29S3,CitationSentence,Sentence,See September 2017 Initial PTSD Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ).
1803547P29S4,FindingSentence,Sentence,"Next, an in-service stressor is established."
1803547P29S5,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's claims of domestic abuse by her then-husband while on active duty are clearly documented in the service treatment records.
1803547P29S6,,EvidenceSentence,"To this end, in-patient service treatment records from May 1993 show that she has suffered multiple contusions from spousal abuse."
1803547P29S7,,EvidenceSentence,Another notation in a March 1993 service treatment record shows a social worker's note that the Veteran was evaluated because of spousal abuse.
1803547P30S1,FindingSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"Finally, there is a link, established by medical evidence, between the current symptoms and the in-service stressor."
1803547P30S2,,EvidenceSentence,The September 2017 VA examiner clearly lists the markers that substantiate the Veteran's stressor of spousal abuse.
1803547P30S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Based on these markers and an examination of the Veteran, this examiner determines that the stressor is related to in-service personal assault."
1803547P30S4,CitationSentence,Sentence,"See September 2017 PTSD DBQ, p. 7."
1803547P30S5,,EvidenceSentence,"She opined that PTSD was at least as likely as not caused by service, and in her rationale, she noted the April 2010 examiner's finding that ""her depression is not specifically related to her HIV, but occurred prior to this, and was associated with domestic violence by her husband . . . ."""
1803547P31S2,,FindingSentence,"In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD related to events of her service."
1803547P31S3,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, service connection is warranted."
1803547P32S1,,ReasoningSentence,"As a final matter, the Board notes that the Veteran's medical records reflect various other psychiatric diagnoses other than PTSD, such as MDD."
1803547P32S2,CitationSentence,Sentence,"See September 2017 PTSD DBQ, p. 3."
1803547P32S3,,EvidenceSentence,The VA examiner found that the symptoms of both exacerbate those of the other and the Veteran's indicated level of social and occupational impairment is 50 percent attributable to MDD and 50 percent attributable to PTSD.
1803547P32S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"As such, the grant of service connection for a psychiatric disorder, namely PTSD, comprehensively encompasses all associated symptoms, including that of the MDD."
1803547P32S5,,CitationSentence,"See DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 53 (2011); Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 86-87 (2009); Clemons, 23 Vet. App. 1."
1803547P33S2,,Sentence,II.
1803547P33S3,,Sentence,Migraine Headaches
1803547P34S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran also avers that her current migraine headaches had its onset in service.
1803547P35S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Board notes that the RO denied service connection for migraine heachaches, to include as secondary to uncontrolled hypertension, partially on the basis that service treatment records were ""found to be silent"" for treatment of migraine headaches."
1803547P35S3,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,This is incorrect.
1803547P35S4,,EvidenceSentence,Multiple entries in the service treatment record show complaints of migraines or headaches in service.
1803547P35S5,,EvidenceSentence,"For instance, migraines/headaches were noted in August 1990, January 1991, April 1991, and April 1992 service treatment entries."
1803547P35S6,,EvidenceSentence,"At a May 1998 Chapter Physical, approximately a month prior to separation from service, the Veteran reported ""yes"" for frequent or severe headaches."
1803547P36S2,LegalRuleSentence,CitationSentence,"Under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(b), an alternative method of establishing the second and third elements is through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology."
1803547P36S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"However, the continuity and chronicity provisions of 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(b) only apply to the chronic diseases enumerated in 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.309(a)."
1803547P36S4,,CitationSentence,"Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013)."
1803547P36S5,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,A July 2013 Addendum Compensation Service Bulletin indicates that migraine headaches should be recognized as an organic disease of the nervous system.
1803547P36S6,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,Organic diseases of the nervous system are chronic diseases.
1803547P36S7,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.309(a).
1803547P36S8,,EvidenceSentence,"In this instance, the Veteran has been diagnosed with migraines."
1803547P36S9,LegalRuleSentence,CitationSentence,"As such, the continuity and chronicity provisions of 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(b) must be considered."
1803547P36S10,,CitationSentence,"See Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271 (2015)."
1803547P37S2,,FindingSentence,The first element of current disability is met.
1803547P37S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology and ""may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection."""
1803547P37S4,,CitationSentence,"Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994)."
1803547P37S5,,ReasoningSentence,"The Veteran has consistently reported headaches (pain in the head) accompanied by a stabbing pain behind her eye, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, and the Board finds that these complaints are ""observable symptomatology"" within the meaning of Layno."
1803547P37S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, these headache complaints have been medically attributed to the currently diagnosed migraine headache disability."
1803547P37S7,,CitationSentence,"See e.g., May 2010 VA-sponsored examination report."
1803547P38S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(b), medical nexus evidence demonstrating an etiological link is not necessary to prove service connection when evidence shows that a veteran had a chronic disease in service and that she still has the same chronic disease."
1803547P38S3,,CitationSentence,"Groves v. Peake, 524 F.3d 1306, 1309-1310 (2008)."
1803547P38S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Here, migraine headaches were noted in service (as mentioned above), the Veteran claims to have had it since service, and she has been treated for migraine headaches post-service."
1803547P38S5,,CitationSentence,See VA Treatment records 2011-2017.
1803547P38S6,,EvidenceSentence,"For instance, the Veteran, at a March 2016 neurological visit, stated that she suffered from headaches for the past 10 years."
1803547P38S7,,ReasoningSentence,The Board finds the Veteran's account of the onset of her headaches since service to be competent and credible and supported by the medical evidence of record.
1803547P39S2,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board notes that a VA examiner in May 2010 indicated that migraines are due to uncontrolled hypertension which is not service-connected; however, exploring this theory is not necessary as the Veteran has demonstrated a chronic migraine disability since service."
1803547P40S2,,FindingSentence,"Accordingly, the Board concludes that the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the headaches first manifested during service and continued since service."
1803547P40S3,FindingSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is warranted."
1803547P40S4,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C.Â§ 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.102.
1803547P41S1,,Sentence,ORDER
1803547P42S2,,Sentence,"Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and MDD, is granted."
1803547P43S2,,Sentence,Service connection for a migraine headache disability is granted.

1803705P15S1,,Sentence,INTRODUCTION
1803705P16S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran served on active duty from February 1989 to May 1994.
1803705P17S2,,CitationSentence,This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. Â§ 20.900(c) (2017).
1803705P17S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 7107(a)(2) (2012).
1803705P18S2,,Sentence,"This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in New Orleans, Louisiana, which originally had jurisdiction over this appeal, and Louisville, Kentucky, to which jurisdiction over this case was transferred and which forwarded the appeal to the Board."
1803705P19S2,,EvidenceSentence,"A temporary total hospitalization rating was assigned to the service-connected PTSD, unspecified depressive disorder, from June 16, 2015, to August 31, 2015."
1803705P19S3,,Sentence,The current claim for an increased rating does not include this period.
1803705P20S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In February 2017, the Veteran testified at a videoconference hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge."
1803705P20S3,,FindingSentence,A written transcript of the hearing has been prepared and incorporated into the evidence of record.
1803705P21S2,,Sentence,"In May 2017, the claims were remanded for additional evidentiary development, and the case has now been returned to the Board for further appellate consideration."
1803705P22S2,,Sentence,This appeal was processed using the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS).
1803705P22S3,,Sentence,"Accordingly, any future consideration of this appellant's case should take into consideration the existence of this electronic record."
1803705P22S4,,Sentence,"In addition to the VBMS file, there is a Legacy Content Manager paperless claims file associated with the Veteran's claims."
1803705P23S1,,Sentence,FINDINGS OF FACT
1803705P24S2,,Sentence,1.
1803705P24S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Throughout the period on appeal and exclusive of a period of a temporary total hospitalization rating, the Veteran's PTSD with unspecified depressive disorder manifested as self-reported sleep disturbance, nightmares, difficulty getting along with others, and isolation tendencies; symptoms attributable to his service-connected PTSD with unspecified depressive disorder resulted in no more that occupational impairment with reduced reliability and productivity."
1803705P25S2,,Sentence,2.
1803705P25S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's service-connected mental health disorder, residuals of stress fracture of the left ankle, and tinnitus, reduce his capacity for working in a high pressure environment or closely with other employees, but do not render him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation."

1803705P29S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
1803705P30S2,,Sentence,Initial Considerations
1803705P31S2,,Sentence,The Board has thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in the Veteran's VA files.
1803705P31S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"In every decision, the Board must provide a statement of the reasons or bases for its determination, adequate to enable an appellant to understand the precise basis for the Board's decision, as well as to facilitate review by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court)."
1803705P31S4,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§ 7104(d)(1) (2012); see Allday v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 517, 527 (1995)."
1803705P31S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"Although the entire record must be reviewed by the Board, the Court has repeatedly found that the Board is not required to discuss, in detail, every piece of evidence."
1803705P31S6,,CitationSentence,"See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143, 149 (2001) (rejecting the notion that the Veterans Claims Assistance Act mandates that the Board discuss all evidence)."
1803705P31S7,,LegalRuleSentence,"Rather, the law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the appellant."
1803705P31S8,,CitationSentence,"See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000)."
1803705P31S9,,Sentence,"The discussion below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claims."
1803705P31S10,,LegalRuleSentence,The appellant must not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed herein.
1803705P31S11,,CitationSentence,"See Timberlake, infra."
1803705P32S2,,Sentence,Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist.
1803705P32S3,,CitationSentence,"See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that ""the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board . . . to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board.""); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument)."
1803705P33S2,,Sentence,Increased Ratings - In General
1803705P34S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which assigns ratings based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability."
1803705P34S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 1155 (2012) ; 38 C.F.R. Part 4 (2017).
1803705P35S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating."
1803705P35S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned."

1803705P43S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name."
1803705P43S3,,Sentence,- 100 percent
1803705P44S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals that interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships."

1803705P45S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships."
1803705P45S3,,Sentence,- 50 percent
1803705P46S2,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"The list of symptoms under the rating criteria are meant to be examples of symptoms that would warrant the evaluation, but are not meant to be exhaustive, and the Board need not find all or even some of the symptoms to award a specific evaluation."

1803705P47S2,,Sentence,Entitlement to an Initial Rating in Excess of 50 Percent for
1803705P48S2,,Sentence,"PTSD, Unspecified Depressive Disorder."
1803705P49S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran asserts that his service-connected PTSD, unspecified depressive disorder, is worse than what is reflected by his current 50 percent rating."
1803705P49S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Specifically, at the recent hearing, he reported sleep disturbance, nightmares, difficulty getting along with others, and isolation tendencies."
1803705P50S2,,EvidenceSentence,Review of the record reflects numerous mental health examinations were conducted by VA over the years.
1803705P50S3,,ReasoningSentence,It is noted that VA examinations and 2008 and 2011 did not diagnose PTSD.
1803705P50S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, VA examination in July 2016 did not find that the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD were met."
1803705P50S5,,EvidenceSentence,"It was specifically noted by the VA examiner that when VA diagnosed PTSD in 2015, no psychological test was utilized, and the diagnosis was based on the Veteran's self-report of symptoms."
1803705P51S2,,Sentence,"The Board remanded the claims for additional development in May 2017, to include a contemporaneous examination to address the severity of PTSD."
1803705P51S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The remand noted that the evidence of record included treatment records subsequent to a July 2016 VA examination report, to include a document which attested to the Veteran's abrasiveness with others."
1803705P51S4,,EvidenceSentence,Also of record was a January 2017 VA physician's statement that reported auditory and visual hallucinations.
1803705P51S5,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,The Board has also considered the February 2017 statements by the Veteran's wife and a DAV representative.
1803705P51S6,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's spouse claimed that he often said that he was going to hurt himself and/or others.
1803705P51S7,,EvidenceSentence,He experienced panic attacks and spent time alone in the woods away from others.
1803705P51S8,,EvidenceSentence,She indicated that he would not bathe or shave.
1803705P51S9,,EvidenceSentence,The DAV representative reported that the Veteran had come into their office on occasion looking unkempt and in pajamas.
1803705P51S10,,EvidenceSentence,He exhibited aggressive behavior and paranoid personality.
1803705P52S2,,EvidenceSentence,Review of the May 2017 VA mental health examination report reflects that the examiner reviewed the claims file.
1803705P52S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The final diagnoses were anti-social personality disorder, stimulant use disorder, and alcohol use disorder."
1803705P52S4,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted that the Veteran's mental health symptoms were attributable to these nonservice-connected conditions.
1803705P52S5,,EvidenceSentence,He agreed with the July 2016 examination report in that the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD were not met.
1803705P52S6,,EvidenceSentence,"For rationale, he pointed to PTSD diagnostic criteria which were not demonstrated, to include intrusion symptoms associated with a traumatic event, persistent avoidance of stimuli, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and marked alterations in arousal and reactivity."
1803705P52S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner also specifically noted that the Veteran's ""idiosyncratic"" responses were not typically seen by those with actual PTSD."
1803705P52S8,,EvidenceSentence,"For example, he gave the same symptoms description for hallucinations, flashbacks, and dreams."
1803705P52S9,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner also noted that the Veteran's responses were inconsistent (as they had been in previous examinations).
1803705P53S2,,FindingSentence,"Clearly, the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an increased disability rating for PTSD and unspecified depressive disorder in excess of 50 percent as his mental health symptoms have been attributed to nonservice-connected conditions."
1803705P53S3,,EvidenceSentence,The most recent compensation examiner agreed with previous examiners that a diagnosis of PTSD was not supported.
1803705P53S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner indicated that other than periods of intoxication and withdrawal, all of the Veteran's symptoms were attributable to his antisocial personality disorder."
1803705P53S5,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,Service connection is not in effect for a personality disorder.
1803705P53S6,,EvidenceSentence,The 2017 examiner agreed with previous examiners and also pointed out that the previous diagnosis of PTSD was inadequate.
1803705P53S7,,FindingSentence,"As the symptoms of the service-connected PTSD and unspecified depressive disorder are not shown to meet or approximate the criteria for a rating in excess of 50 percent, a higher initial rating is not warranted."
1803705P53S8,,ReasoningSentence,"There is no reasonable doubt to be resolved, and the claim must be denied."

1803705P54S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"In making this determination, the Board considered the Veteran's reported history of symptomatology for his service-connected PTSD."
1803705P54S3,,ReasoningSentence,It is acknowledged that he is competent to report such symptoms and observations because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes through his senses.
1803705P54S4,,CitationSentence,"Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994)."
1803705P54S5,,ReasoningSentence,"However, the more probative evidence concerning the nature and extent of the Veteran's disabilities has been provided in the medical evidence of record."
1803705P54S6,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,This evidence considers whether the Veteran manifests an acquired psychiatric disorder.
1803705P54S7,,LegalRuleSentence,(Personality disorders are not diseases or injuries within the meaning of applicable legislation.
1803705P54S8,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(c).)

1803705P58S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"It is clear that the claimant need not be a total ""basket case"" before the courts find that there is an inability to engage in substantial gainful activity."
1803705P58S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"The question must be looked at in a practical manner, and mere theoretical ability to engage in substantial gainful employment is not a sufficient basis to deny benefits."
1803705P58S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,The test is whether a particular job is realistically within the physical and mental capabilities of the claimant.
1803705P58S5,CitationSentence,Sentence,"Moore, 1 Vet. App. at 359."
1803705P59S2,LegalRuleSentence,FindingSentence,"As noted above, a claim for a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability ""presupposes that the rating for the [service-connected] condition is less than 100%, and only asks for TDIU because of 'subjective' factors that the 'objective' rating does not consider."""
1803705P59S3,,CitationSentence,"Vettese v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. at 34-35."
1803705P60S2,,Sentence,"In Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164 (1991), the Court referred to apparent conflicts in the regulations pertaining to individual unemployability benefits."
1803705P60S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Specifically, the Court indicated there was a need to discuss whether the standard delineated in the controlling regulations was an ""objective"" one based on the average industrial impairment or a ""subjective"" one based upon the veteran's actual industrial impairment."
1803705P60S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"In a pertinent precedent decision, the VA General Counsel concluded that the controlling VA regulations generally provide that veterans who, in light of their individual circumstances, but without regard to age, are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation as the result of service-connected disability shall be rated totally disabled, without regard to whether an average person would be rendered unemployable by the circumstances."
1803705P60S5,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Thus, the criteria include a subjective standard."

1803705P61S2,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"In determining whether unemployability exists, consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training and previous work experience, but not to his age or to any impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities."

1803705P62S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"A total disability rating for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more."
1803705P62S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"If there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and the combined rating must be 70 percent or more."

1803705P66S3,FindingSentence,EvidenceSentence,His combined disability rating of 60 percent does not meet the criteria for consideration of a TDIU.
1803705P66S4,,LegalRuleSentence,The Board does not have the authority to assign an extra-schedular total disability rating for compensation purposes based on individual unemployability in the first instance.
1803705P67S2,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board will consider whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities render him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation, such that referral for extra-schedular consideration is warranted."
1803705P68S2,,EvidenceSentence,The evidence of record reflects that the Veteran last worked in 2008 in a temporary position.
1803705P68S3,,EvidenceSentence,"In 2015, he reported work experience as a cook and completion of high school."
1803705P69S2,EvidenceSentence,FindingSentence,"As noted above, his mental health symptoms, which are significant, have been attributed to psychiatric disorders other than his service-connected PTSD with depressive features."
1803705P69S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Subsequent to the Board's 2017 remand, additional examination was conducted to determine the severity of his service-connected left ankle."
1803705P69S4,,EvidenceSentence,The June 2017 report reflects that X-ray was interpreted as normal.
1803705P69S5,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted that the Veteran's complaints of ankle pain were not congruent with the actual physical findings.
1803705P69S6,,EvidenceSentence,There simply was no objective evidence that supported his reports of left ankle limitations.
1803705P69S7,,ReasoningSentence,"His tinnitus is noted by the Board, but the report did not include discussion of this disorder."
1803705P70S2,FindingSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD, left ankle fracture residuals, and tinnitus, on their own, do not make him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation."
1803705P70S3,,ReasoningSentence,"Therefore, there is no basis to refer the TDIU claim for extra-schedular consideration."
1803705P70S4,,Sentence,The Board has considered the Veteran's reported history of symptomatology for his service-connected disabilities.
1803705P70S5,,ReasoningSentence,It is acknowledged that he is competent to report such symptoms and observations because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes through his senses.

1804436P19S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"Where a claimant, or the record, reasonably raises the question of whether the Veteran is unemployable due to the disability for which a higher rating is sought, then part and parcel to that claim for a higher rating is the matter of whether a total rating based on individual unemployability (""TDIU"") as a result of that disability is warranted."

1804436P26S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION
1804436P27S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Before assessing the merits of the appeal, VA's duties under the Veterans Claims Assistance Act (""VCAA"") must be examined."
1804436P27S3,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,The VCAA provides that VA shall apprise a claimant of the evidence necessary to substantiate his or her claim for benefits and that VA shall make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence unless no reasonable possibility exists that such assistance will aid in substantiating the claim.

1804436P29S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"The Board is aware of the decision in Vazquez-Flores v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 37 (2008) in which the Court held that, for an increased-compensation claim, section Â§ 5103(a) requires, at a minimum, VA notify the claimant that, to substantiate a claim, the claimant must provide, or ask VA to obtain, medical or lay evidence demonstrating a worsening or increase in severity of the disability and the effect that worsening has on the claimant's employment and daily life."
1804436P29S3,,FindingSentence,"Relying on the informal guidance from VA's Office of General Counsel (""OGC"") and a VA Fast Letter issued in June 2008 (Fast Letter 08-16; June 2, 2008), the Board finds that Vazquez-Flores is not applicable."
1804436P29S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"According to OGC, because this appeal arises from an initial rating decision, VCAA notice obligations are satisfied fully once service connection has been granted."
1804436P29S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"Any further notice and assistance requirements are covered by 38 U.S.C.

1804436P30S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In Dingess v. Nicholson, the Court held that, in cases where service connection has been granted and an initial disability rating and effective date have been assigned, the typical service-connection claim has been more than substantiated, it has been proven, thereby rendering section 5103(a) notice no longer required because the purpose that the notice is intended to serve has been fulfilled."
1804436P30S3,,CitationSentence,"See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 490-91 (2006)."
1804436P30S4,,FindingSentence,"To the extent that Dingess requires more extensive notice as to potential downstream issues such as disability rating and effective date, because the currently appealed rating decision was fully favorable to the Veteran on the issue of service connection for PTSD, and because the Veteran was fully informed of the evidence needed to substantiate this claim, the Board finds no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with the present decision."
1804436P30S5,,CitationSentence,"See also Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 394 (1993)."
1804436P31S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"With respect to the timing of the notice, the Board points out that the Court has held that a VCAA notice, as required by 38 U.S.C.

1804436P31S3,,CitationSentence,"See Pelegrini, 18 Vet. App. at 112."
1804436P31S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Here, all relevant notice was issued prior to the currently appealed rating decisions; thus, this notice was timely."

1804436P32S2,FindingSentence,LegalRuleSentence,The Board also finds that VA has complied with the VCAA's duty to assist by aiding the Veteran in obtaining evidence and affording him the opportunity to give testimony before the Board.
1804436P32S3,,EvidenceSentence,It appears that all known and available records relevant to the issues on appeal have been obtained and associated with the Veteran's claims file; the Veteran has not contended otherwise.
1804436P32S4,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,This includes records identified by the Board in the August 2017 remand order.
1804436P32S5,,EvidenceSentence,A review of the file indicates that the requested updated VA treatment record have been obtained and properly associated with the Veteran's claims file.
1804436P32S6,,CitationSentence,"See Stegall, 11 Vet. App. 268 at 271."
1804436P33S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran has been provided with multiple VA examinations which addressed the Veteran's reported symptoms, frequency, and severity and the interference these symptoms cause in his ability to complete basic daily tasks."

1804436P33S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Most recently, the Veteran was provided with a VA examination and medical opinion in August 2017, as requested by the Board's prior remand."
1804436P33S5,,CitationSentence,"See Stegall, 11 Vet. App. 268 at 271."
1804436P33S6,,EvidenceSentence,"During this August 2017 VA examination, the pertinent medical history was noted by the examiner and the examiner's findings were set forth in detail, allowing for informed appellate review under applicable VA laws and regulations."
1804436P33S7,FindingSentence,ReasoningSentence,"Thus, the Board finds the examination of record are adequate for rating purposes and an additional examination is not necessary regarding the claim adjudicated in this decision."

1804436P34S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran was afforded the opportunity to appear and testify before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (""VLJ"") via video conference hearing in August 2017."
1804436P34S3,LegalRuleSentence,CitationSentence,"In Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488 (2010), the Court held that 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.103(c)(2) requires that the Veterans Law Judge (""VLJ"") who conducts a hearing fulfill two duties to comply with the above regulation."
1804436P34S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,These duties consist of (1) the duty to fully explain the issues and (2) the duty to suggest the submission of evidence that may have been overlooked.
1804436P34S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Here, during the hearing, the VLJ noted the basis of the prior determination and noted the element of the claims that was lacking to substantiate the claims for benefits."
1804436P34S6,,EvidenceSentence,The VLJ specifically noted the issues as including the issues listed on the title page of this decision.
1804436P34S7,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was assisted at the hearing by an accredited representative from the Texas Veteran Commission.
1804436P34S8,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,The representative and the VLJ then asked questions to ascertain whether the Veteran had submitted evidence in support of these claims.
1804436P34S9,,EvidenceSentence,"In addition, the VLJ sought to identify any pertinent evidence not currently associated with the claims folder that might have been overlooked or was outstanding that might substantiate the claims."
1804436P34S10,,FindingSentence,"As such, the Board finds that, consistent with Bryant, the VLJ complied with the duties set forth in 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.103(c)(2) and that any error in notice provided during the Veteran's hearing constitutes harmless error."
1804436P35S2,FindingSentence,ReasoningSentence,"Based upon the above, the Board finds that VA has done everything reasonably possible to notify and to assist the Veteran and no further action is necessary to meet the requirements of the VCAA."
1804436P35S3,,Sentence,"Moreover, the neither the Veteran nor his representative have advanced any procedural arguments in relation to VA's duties to notify and assist."
1804436P35S4,,CitationSentence,"See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that ""absent extraordinary circumstances . . . we think it is appropriate for the Board and the Veterans Court to address only those procedural arguments specifically raised by the veteran . . ."")."
1804436P35S5,FindingSentence,ReasoningSentence,"Hence, there is no error or issue that precludes the Board from addressing the merits of this appeal."
1804436P36S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"Lastly, the Board has thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in the Veteran's claims file."
1804436P36S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, all of the evidence submitted by the Veteran or on his behalf."
1804436P36S4,,CitationSentence,"See Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the Board must review the entire record, but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence)."

1804436P37S2,,Sentence,Governing Laws and Regulations for Increased Ratings Claims:
1804436P38S2,LegalRuleSentence,CitationSentence,"Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (""Rating Schedule""), found in 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.1 (2017)."
1804436P38S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disabilities resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of, or incident to, military service."
1804436P38S4,,LegalRuleSentence,Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition.
1804436P38S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations."
1804436P38S6,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.10.
1804436P38S7,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"As such, each disability must be considered from the point of view of the veteran working or seeking work."
1804436P38S8,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.2.
1804436P39S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the Veteran."

1804436P39S4,,LegalRuleSentence,Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present.
1804436P39S5,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991)."
1804436P39S6,,ReasoningSentence,"Although the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings, the Board is to consider the Veteran's medical history in determining the applicability of a higher rating for the entire period in which the appeal has been pending."
1804436P39S7,,CitationSentence,"Powell v. West, 13 Vet. App. 31, 34 (1999)."
1804436P40S2,,Sentence,"Where, as here, the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, the relevant time period for consideration begins on the date that the claim for service connection was filed."

1804436P40S4,,Sentence,"In the instant appeal, that date is March 17, 2009."
1804436P41S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, the Board acknowledges that a Veteran may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation."

1804436P41S4,,ReasoningSentence,The following analysis is therefore undertaken with consideration of the possibility that different ratings may be warranted for different time periods.
1804436P42S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the resulting disability and coordination of rating with impairment of function."
1804436P42S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.21.
1804436P42S4,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"Therefore, the Board has considered the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of his disability in reaching its decision."
1804436P42S5,,CitationSentence,"Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991)."
1804436P43S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating."
1804436P43S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned."
1804436P43S4,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.7.
1804436P44S2,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"The Board notes that in analyzing this claim, the Secretary, and therefore the Board, has an obligation to provide the Veteran with the ""benefit of the doubt"" on questions material to this decisions, for which there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence."

1804436P45S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"When evaluating a service-connected mental disorder, VA will review the Veteran's medical history to determine how badly the disorder has disrupted his social and occupational functioning."
1804436P45S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Specifically, VA must review the frequency, severity, and duration of the psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission."
1804436P45S4,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.126(a).
1804436P45S5,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,The evaluation must be based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination.
1804436P45S6,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.126(a).
1804436P45S7,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"While the extent of a Veteran's social impairment is considered, the rating cannot be assigned on these limitations alone."

1804436P47S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"In the instant appeal, the AOJ granted service connection for PTSD and assigned disability ratings under Diagnostic Code 9411."
1804436P47S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Under this Diagnostic Code, a 50 percent rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short-and long-term memory; impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships."
1804436P47S4,,CitationSentence,Id.
1804436P48S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A 70 percent evaluation is warranted where there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships."

1804436P53S1,,EvidenceSentence,"In addition to evidence regarding the Veteran's symptomatology and its impact on his social and occupational functioning, a Global Assessment of Functioning (""GAF"") score is another component considered to determine the entire disability picture for the Veteran."
1804436P53S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The GAF score is a scale reflecting the ""psychological, social, and occupational functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental health-illness"" from 0 to 100, with 100 representing superior functioning in a wide range of activities and no psychiatric symptoms."

1804436P54S3,,EvidenceSentence,"For example, a GAF score of 51 to 60 represents ""[m]oderate symptoms (e.g., flat affect and circumstantial speech, occasional panic attacks); or moderate difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning, (e.g., few friends, conflicts with peers or co-workers)."""
1804436P54S4,CitationSentence,Sentence,DSM-IV at 46-47.

1804436P56S2,,FindingSentence,"That being the relevant law applicable to the Veteran's claim for an increased rating of his PTSD, the Board finds evidence of record is consistent with the assignment of an initial 70 percent evaluation for the Veteran's PTSD, effective March 17, 2009."
1804436P56S3,,ReasoningSentence,"Beginning on and after March 17, 2009, the Veteran's service-connected PTSD is manifested by psychiatric symptoms more nearly approximating occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, which is required for a 70 percent rating."
1804436P56S4,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130.
1804436P56S5,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"The Board has also considered additional, similar symptomatology not specifically addressed in the 70 percent criteria, but causing the appropriate level of occupational and social impairment for a 70 percent rating, under the General Rating Formula."
1804436P56S6,,CitationSentence,"Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 442."
1804436P56S7,,ReasoningSentence,"In making this determination, the Board has reviewed both the medical and lay evidence of record: the Veteran's lay statements, arguments from his representative, and VA psychological examination dated in January 2011 and August 2017."
1804436P57S2,,ReasoningSentence,"In reaching this determination, the Board finds that the Veteran's overall PTSD symptoms more nearly approximate a 70 percent disability evaluation beginning on and after March 17, 2009."
1804436P57S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The medical and lay evidence of record document these symptoms to include social isolation, constant depression, anxiety, frequent panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, irritability, hypervigilance, increased startle responses, flashbacks, persistent nightmares three to four times per week, insomnia, mild memory loss, difficulty concentrating, loss of interest, and suicidal ideations."
1804436P57S4,,EvidenceSentence,"VA treatment records and VA examinations essentially document that the Veteran's signs and symptoms have remained essentially unchanged since his initial grant of entitlement to service connection on March 17, 2009."
1804436P57S5,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,These consistent and chronic reports of symptoms provide support for the assignment of an initial evaluation of 70 percent.
1804436P58S2,,FindingSentence,"Significantly, the Board finds that the evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms have remained consistent, and unchanged, despite medication and counseling."
1804436P58S3,,EvidenceSentence,"During his initial counseling sessions, the Veteran endorsed nearly daily panic attacks, persistent nightmares, and repeated intrusive thoughts from his service in Vietnam."
1804436P58S4,,CitationSentence,"See Conroe CBOC Records, dated August 2010."
1804436P58S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The examining clinician observed that the Veteran was cooperative, but displayed a depressed and anxious demeanor."
1804436P58S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Following this evaluation, the Veteran's medications were increased; however, subsequent encounters show little to no effect on the Veteran's overall level of functioning."
1804436P58S7,,EvidenceSentence,"For example, during an examination in June 2011, the clinician reported the Veteran's PTSD remained unchanged, with the Veteran experiencing daily panic attacks, and persistent symptoms."
1804436P58S8,,EvidenceSentence,"The examining clinician additionally observed that the Veteran appeared to be ""more irate"" despite the prior increases to his medications."
1804436P59S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"This pattern of ""persistent"" and ""chronic"" symptoms is continued throughout subsequent evaluations of the Veteran."
1804436P59S3,,EvidenceSentence,"For example, during a counseling session in August 2011, the Veteran reported daily intrusive thoughts/memories from Vietnam."
1804436P59S4,,CitationSentence,See Conroe CBOC Records.
1804436P59S5,,EvidenceSentence,"He reported that he tries to keep himself busy in order to avoid these memories, but is unable to control them."
1804436P59S6,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran additionally endorsed daily panic attacks, described as sweating, rapid heart rate, feelings of dizziness, and faintness."
1804436P59S7,,EvidenceSentence,"In February 2013, the Veteran continued to report nearly daily panic attacks and described his level of anxiety as ""out of control."""
1804436P59S8,,EvidenceSentence,"During this encounter, the Veteran stated that he is ""irritated"" by people in general, and ""cannot stand to be touched"" due to his exaggerated startle response and persistent hypervigilance."
1804436P59S9,,EvidenceSentence,"The examining clinician observed that the Veteran was ""tearful"" throughout the encounter while he discussed his symptoms of PTSD."
1804436P59S10,,EvidenceSentence,"See also Conroe CBOC Records, dated February 2015 where Veteran is described as ""sad and anxious"" throughout evaluation."
1804436P60S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In addition to the Veteran's chronic anxiety and panic attacks, the medical and lay evidence of record demonstrate significant social impairment due to symptoms of depression and isolation."
1804436P60S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's wife submitted a letter on his behalf, in which she described the Veteran's tendency to isolate from others and to avoid interacting with family."
1804436P60S4,,CitationSentence,See September 2010 Correspondence from A.H.
1804436P60S5,,ReasoningSentence,These lay descriptions of the Veteran are corroborated by statements made during counseling sessions.
1804436P60S6,,EvidenceSentence,"For example, during his January 2011 VA examination, the Veteran reported feelings of social isolation and withdrawal and stated he experiences persistent feels of worthlessness and does not wish to interact with anyone on a regular or sustained basis."
1804436P60S7,,EvidenceSentence,Similar reports were made during the Veteran's August 2017 VA examination.
1804436P61S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and hypervigilance additionally cause him to experience impaired sleep."
1804436P61S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran has consistently reported nightmares occurring on average three to four times per night."
1804436P61S4,,CitationSentence,See Conroe CBOC Records.
1804436P61S5,,EvidenceSentence,"As a result, the Veteran reported that he is able to sleep no more than four to five hours per night, which causes him to experience increased symptoms of irritability and anxiety during the day."
1804436P61S6,,EvidenceSentence,The frequency of his nightmares has not improved with either counseling or medication.
1804436P61S7,,EvidenceSentence,"Rather, in recent statements to the Board, the Veteran reports his nightmares have worsened such that he is no longer able to sleep in the same room as his wife."
1804436P61S8,,CitationSentence,See December 2017 Correspondence.
1804436P62S2,ReasoningSentence,FindingSentence,The Board has additionally reviewed and considered the GAF scores assigned to the Veteran during the pendency of his appeal.
1804436P62S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Notably, the Board observes that the Veteran's GAF scores have remained more or less unchanged since his initial diagnosis, thus suggesting the persistent and chronic nature of his symptoms."
1804436P62S4,,EvidenceSentence,"For example, during an August 2010 examination, the Veteran's overall level of functioning was assigned a GAF of 53, which is indicative of moderate symptoms."
1804436P62S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Thereafter, during a February 2013 examination, the Veteran was assigned a GAF score of 50, which is indicative of serious symptoms."
1804436P62S6,,EvidenceSentence,Subsequent evaluations of the Veteran reflect GAF scores between 50 and 55.
1804436P62S7,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The Board finds these GAF scores to be consistent with the assignment of an initial 70 percent evaluation, as they indicate the Veteran experiences chronic difficulties in his social functioning and due to daily symptoms of anxiety, hypervigilance, and depression."
1804436P63S2,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board is aware that the two VA examinations of record, dated January 2011 and August 2017, contain medical opinions which suggest the Veteran's overall level of functioning is consistent with a continued 50 percent disability evaluation."
1804436P63S3,,ReasoningSentence,"While the Board has considered these opinions, the Board finds that the longitudinal evidence of record is more consistent with the assignment of an initial 70 percent disability evaluation."
1804436P63S4,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"As explained in greater detail above, the medical and lay evidence of record document persistent and daily symptoms which impair the Veteran's ability to maintain social relationships and perform daily chores/activities."
1804436P64S2,,ReasoningSentence,"However, while totality of the evidence shows the Veteran's symptoms are consistent with an initial 70 percent disability rating throughout the entire appeal period, the Board finds no credible evidence which would suggest the Veteran's symptoms meet the criteria for a higher evaluation."
1804436P64S3,,ReasoningSentence,"The medical and lay evidence beginning on and after March 17, 2009, are not indicative of someone with psychiatric symptomatology causing total occupational and social impairment, which is required for the 100 percent rating."
1804436P64S4,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130.
1804436P64S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Specifically, there is no evidence which documents a gross impairment in thought process or communication; there is no evidence of any delusions or hallucinations; no grossly inappropriate behavior; no ""persistent"" danger of hurting himself; no disorientation to time or place; and no memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name."
1804436P64S6,,CitationSentence,Id.
1804436P65S2,,EvidenceSentence,General observations of the Veteran throughout the period on appeal do not suggest he ever struggled to maintain or neglected his personal hygiene.
1804436P65S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Rather, he was consistently observed to be appropriately dressed and ""neatly groomed."""
1804436P65S4,,EvidenceSentence,"For example, during the January 2011 VA examination, the Veteran was described as ""neatly groomed."""
1804436P65S5,,EvidenceSentence,Similar observations were made during the Veteran's August 2017 VA examination.
1804436P65S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Furthermore, throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran was able to independently care for himself and his personal hygiene."
1804436P66S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Most significantly, the overall medical record does not show any periods of in-patient psychiatric hospitalizations or loss of functioning."
1804436P66S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Rather, the Veteran is treated on an out-patient basis and treated with medications."
1804436P66S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The totality of these individual therapy reports show the Veteran continued to experience social limitations due to his anxiety, hyperarousal, and mood liability."
1804436P66S5,,ReasoningSentence,"However, despite these limitations, the totality of the evidence is not suggestive of total social impairment."
1804436P66S6,,ReasoningSentence,"In sum, the Board finds no medical or lay evidence which shows the Veteran's symptoms resulted in total social impairment."
1804436P67S1,FindingSentence,ReasoningSentence,"From an occupational standpoint, the Board finds no evidence which suggests the Veteran's symptoms result in a total impairment."
1804436P67S2,,EvidenceSentence,"For example, during his January 2011 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he had worked for 26 years with AT&T, as a customer service technician, and retired less than a year prior to the examination."
1804436P67S3,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"This report is significant, because it shows the Veteran was capable of interacting with others on a sustained basis while employed as customer service technician."
1804436P67S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Since his retirement, the Veteran has been able to engage in a range of daily chores including tending to his family property, planting and harvesting fruit trees, and caring for his family's animals."
1804436P67S5,,CitationSentence,"See e.g. Conroe CBOC Records, dated February 2013, and July 2015, July 2017."
1804436P67S6,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran additionally testified that he currently has two online businesses.
1804436P67S7,,CitationSentence,See Hearing Transcript.
1804436P67S8,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Thus, while the Board acknowledges the Veteran experiences deficits within his social functioning, as described above and as reflected in the assignment of a 70 percent evaluation, his symptoms do result in the level of occupation impairment contemplated by a 100 percent disability evaluation."
1804436P68S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Similarly, while the Veteran endorses avoidance of certain activities and locations, the overall evidence does not suggest his PTSD precludes him from performing regular daily activities and chores."
1804436P68S3,,EvidenceSentence,"During his August 2017 hearing, the Veteran testified that he is able to raise catfish on his farm, and additionally sells the fish online as a business."
1804436P68S4,,CitationSentence,See Hearing Transcript.
1804436P68S5,,EvidenceSentence,At no time during the period on appeal has there Veteran reported or alleged any difficulties in his ability to complete daily tasks and chores around the house.
1804436P69S2,,Sentence,The Board has additionally considered whether the Veteran's service-connected PTSD symptoms warrant the assignment of an extraschedular evaluation.
1804436P69S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,The determination of whether a claimant is entitled to an extra-schedular rating under 3.321 is a three-step inquiry.
1804436P69S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"First, it must be determined whether the evidence presents such an exceptional disability picture that the available schedular evaluations for that service-connected disability are inadequate."
1804436P69S5,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"If the criteria reasonably describe the claimant's disability level and symptomatology, then the claimant's disability picture is contemplated by the rating schedule, the assigned schedular evaluation is, therefore, adequate, and no referral is required."
1804436P69S6,,CitationSentence,"Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111, 115-16 (2008)."
1804436P70S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Second, if the schedular evaluation does not contemplate the claimant's level of disability and symptomatology and is found inadequate, the Board must determine whether the claimant's exceptional disability picture exhibits other related factors such as ""marked interference with employment"" and ""frequent periods of hospitalization."""
1804436P70S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Third, when an analysis of the first two steps reveals that the rating schedule is inadequate to evaluate a claimant's disability picture and that picture has attendant thereto related factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization, then the case must be referred to the Under Secretary for Benefits or the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service to determine whether, to accord justice, the claimant's disability picture requires the assignment of an extra-schedular rating."
1804436P70S4,,CitationSentence,Id.
1804436P71S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"The Federal Circuit provided guidance in rating psychiatric disabilities, emphasizing that the list of symptoms under a given rating is nonexhaustive."
1804436P71S3,CitationSentence,Sentence,"Vazquez-Claudio, supra."
1804436P71S4,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"The psychiatric symptoms present in this case are either listed in the schedular criteria or are similar in kind to those listed, as discussed above."
1804436P71S5,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,Review of the record does not reveal that the Veteran suffers from any symptoms of PTSD that are not contemplated in the nonexhaustive list of symptoms found in the schedular criteria.
1804436P71S6,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"Furthermore, the rating schedule provides for greater compensation for greater disability than that suffered by the Veteran."
1804436P71S7,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, the Board finds that the rating criteria reasonably describe the Veteran's disability level and symptomatology of his service-connected PTSD."
1804436P71S8,,FindingSentence,"As such, the Board finds that the rating schedule is adequate to evaluate the Veteran's disability picture."
1804436P72S2,,FindingSentence,"Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence supports an initial disability rating of 70 percent, but no higher, for the service-connected PTSD throughout the entire appeal period."
1804436P72S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.3.
1804436P72S4,,ReasoningSentence,"It is not necessary to ""stage"" the Veteran's ratings any further than discussed above, as the Veteran's PTSD symptoms have been consistent at the 70 percent levels for the respective time period delineated by the Board in the present decision."
1804436P72S5,,CitationSentence,"Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126."
1804436P72S6,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, from March 17, 2009 to the present, the Board concludes the evidence supports an initial 70 percent rating, but no higher, for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD."
1804436P72S7,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.3.
1804436P73S1,,Sentence,ORDER
1804436P74S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Subject to the laws and regulations governing the payment of VA compensation, entitlement to an increased initial rating of 70 percent, but no greater, for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD is granted for the period beginning on and after March 17, 2009."

1804539P15S2,,Sentence,"Anthony Flamini, Counsel"
1804539P16S1,,Sentence,INTRODUCTION
1804539P17S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran served on active duty from June 1971 to September 1977.
1804539P18S2,,EvidenceSentence,"These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2012 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Portland, Oregon."
1804539P19S2,,Sentence,The Veteran testified at a Board videoconference hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in February 2017.
1804539P19S3,,Sentence,A transcript of that hearing has been associated with the claims file.
1804539P20S1,,Sentence,The issue of entitlement to service connection for a chronic headache disorder is addressed in the REMAND portion of the decision below and is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).
1804539P21S1,,Sentence,FINDINGS OF FACT
1804539P22S2,,Sentence,1.
1804539P22S3,,FindingSentence,"In January 2004, the RO issued a rating decision which denied the Veteran's original claim seeking entitlement to service connection for PTSD; the Veteran did not appeal that decision and new and material evidence was not received within the appeal period."
1804539P23S2,,Sentence,2.
1804539P23S3,,FindingSentence,Evidence received since the January 2004 rating decision is new as it has not been previously submitted to agency decision makers; the evidence also relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability and raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating that claim.
1804539P24S2,,Sentence,3.
1804539P24S3,,FindingSentence,"Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the record reflects a valid diagnosis of PTSD with major depressive disorder during the pendency of the appeal that is related to an in-service stressor, the occurrence of which is supported by credible evidence."
1804539P25S1,,Sentence,CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1804539P26S2,,Sentence,1.
1804539P26S3,,Sentence,The January 2004 rating decision is final.

1804539P29S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
1804539P30S2,,Sentence,"Here, the Board is reopening the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD."
1804539P30S3,,FindingSentence,"Additionally, the Board is granting the reopened claim of entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as PTSD with major depressive disorder."
1804539P30S4,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,These actions are the only matters decided herein and are favorable to the Veteran.
1804539P30S5,,ReasoningSentence,"Therefore, no discussion of VA's duties to notify or assist is necessary as it pertains to the issues on appeal."
1804539P30S6,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.159 (2017)."
1804539P31S2,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"In order to reopen a claim which has been previously denied and which is final, the claimant must present new and material evidence."
1804539P31S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5108 (West 2014).
1804539P31S4,,Sentence,"If the claim is reopened, it will be reviewed on a de novo basis."

1804539P31S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"""New"" evidence is defined as existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decision-makers."
1804539P31S7,,LegalRuleSentence,"""Material"" evidence means evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim."
1804539P31S8,,LegalRuleSentence,"New and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence previously of record, and it must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim."
1804539P31S9,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.156(a) (2017).
1804539P32S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In Hodge v. West, 155 F.3d 1356, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) noted that new evidence could be sufficient to reopen a claim if it could contribute to a more complete picture of the circumstances surrounding the origin of a claimant's injury or disability, even where it would not be enough to convince the Board to grant a claim."
1804539P33S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In determining whether evidence is new and material, the credibility of the evidence is generally presumed."
1804539P33S3,,CitationSentence,"Justus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 512-513 (1992)."
1804539P33S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"In Elkins v. West, 12 Vet. App. 209 (1999), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held the Board must first determine whether the claimant has presented new and material evidence under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.156(a) in order to have a finally denied claim reopened under 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5108."
1804539P33S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"Then, if new and material evidence has been submitted, the Board may proceed to evaluate the merits of the claim, but only after ensuring that VA's duty to assist has been fulfilled."
1804539P33S6,,CitationSentence,"See Vargas-Gonzalez v. West, 12 Vet. App. 321, 328 (1999)."
1804539P33S7,,LegalRuleSentence,"The Court also held that the law should be interpreted to enable reopening of a claim, rather than to preclude it."
1804539P33S8,,CitationSentence,"See Shade v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 110, 117 (2010)."
1804539P34S2,,Sentence,"Here, in a January 2004 rating decision, the RO denied the Veteran's original claim seeking entitlement to service connection for PTSD."
1804539P34S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Specifically, the RO determined that the evidence did not show a confirmed diagnosis of PTSD."
1804539P34S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran did not disagree with this decision in a timely manner, and no additional pertinent evidence was received in the year following the decision."
1804539P34S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. 3.156(b).
1804539P34S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Under these circumstances, the January 2004 rating decision became final."
1804539P34S7,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 7105(c) (West 2002), 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103 (2003); currently 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 7105(c) (West 2014), 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103 (2017)."
1804539P35S2,,Sentence,"In February 2011, the Veteran filed his present claim seeking to reopen the claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder."
1804539P35S3,,EvidenceSentence,This appeal arises from the RO's June 2012 rating decision which reopened the Veteran's claim but then denied the reopened claim on the merits after it was determined that the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis of PTSD related to his military service or any in-service stressor.
1804539P35S4,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"Regardless of the RO's actions, the Board must still determine whether new and material evidence has been received."
1804539P35S5,,CitationSentence,"See Jackson v. Principi, 265 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2001)."
1804539P36S2,,EvidenceSentence,Evidence added to the record since the January 2004 rating decision includes the report of an August 2014 VA examination which concluded that the Veteran experienced symptoms that met the DSM-V criteria for PTSD that were more likely than not caused by events that occurred during his military service.
1804539P37S2,,ReasoningSentence,The Board finds that the evidence associated with the record since the January 2004 rating decision is new in the sense that it was not previously before agency decision makers.
1804539P37S3,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,The Board also finds that this evidence is material because it relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the underlying service connection claim.
1804539P37S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Specifically, the August 2014 VA examination report indicated that he had a current diagnosis of PTSD during the appeal period."
1804539P37S5,,ReasoningSentence,This opinion also suggests that the Veteran's current PTSD is linked to his in-service stressor.
1804539P37S6,,ReasoningSentence,"When considered along with the remaining evidence of record, including his lay statements and service treatment records corroborating the occurrence of his in-service stressor, the Board finds that this new evidence raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the Veteran's claim."
1804539P37S7,,CitationSentence,"See Shade, 24 Vet. App. at 117 (finding that the threshold for determining whether new and material evidence raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating a claim is ""low."")."
1804539P37S8,,FindingSentence,"As the credibility of the new evidence is generally presumed, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is reopened."
1804539P37S9,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.156.
1804539P38S2,,Sentence,"Having reopened the Veteran's service connection claim, the Board will now consider it on the merits."
1804539P38S3,,Sentence,"The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and depressive disorder."
1804539P38S4,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,He attributes his current psychiatric disorders to his military service.
1804539P38S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Specifically, the Veteran asserts that while on shore leave in the Philippines he was attacked in a dark alley while leaving a bar and stabbed in the hand; the Veteran claimed that he then knocked the person down and stomped on him until he stopped moving, believing that he had killed the man."
1804539P38S6,,EvidenceSentence,He contends that his current PTSD and depression are the direct result of this and other in-service stressor events.
1804539P39S2,,LegalRuleSentence,Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.

1804539P39S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(d).
1804539P40S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R.

1804539P41S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor."

1804539P42S2,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"A determination that a Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy may be supported by any evidence which is probative of that fact, and there is no specific limitation of the type or form of evidence that may be used to support such a finding."

1804539P42S7,,CitationSentence,"Sizemore  v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 264 (2004)."
1804539P43S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"If a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor."
1804539P43S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"For purposes of this paragraph, ""fear of hostile military or terrorist activity"" means that a veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror."

1804539P45S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"It is the Board's responsibility to determine whether a preponderance of the evidence supports the claim or whether the evidence is in relative equipoise, with the veteran prevailing in either event, or whether there is a preponderance of evidence against the claim, in which case the claim must be denied."

1804539P45S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"In making that decision, the Board must determine the probative weight to be ascribed as among multiple medical opinions, and state the reasons and bases for favoring one opinion over another."

1804539P45S6,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"This responsibility is particularly important where, as here, medical opinions diverge."
1804539P45S7,,LegalRuleSentence,"The Board is also mindful that it cannot make its own independent medical determinations, and that there must be plausible reasons for favoring one medical opinion over another."
1804539P45S8,,CitationSentence,"See Evans at 31; see also Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171 (1991)."
1804539P46S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Here, the Veteran was provided with a VA PTSD examination in May 2012."
1804539P46S3,,EvidenceSentence,"After an examination of the Veteran, the examiner opined that:"
1804539P47S2,,EvidenceSentence,[The Veteran] does not meet criteria for PTSD.
1804539P47S3,,EvidenceSentence,He reported few symptoms of PTSD.
1804539P47S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The symptoms he reported mostly fall under Criterion D, hyperarousal."
1804539P47S5,,EvidenceSentence,By far the most prominent symptom he described is anger.
1804539P48S2,,EvidenceSentence,[The Veteran] reported that he has been prone to depression.
1804539P48S3,,EvidenceSentence,He said his depression has improved substantially on medication.
1804539P48S4,,EvidenceSentence,He reported experiencing depressed mood periodically but no other symptoms of depression.
1804539P49S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Overall, [the Veteran] described a history of problems with anger starting during his time in Vietnam."
1804539P49S3,,EvidenceSentence,"He described a history of other symptoms of PTSD, including nightmares and intrusive distressing memories, but said those have significantly reduced."
1804539P49S4,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, although it is plausible his difficulties with depression and anger were caused by his experiences while serving in the military, there is no information available to strongly support strongly a causal link between specific events and his current difficulties."
1804539P50S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was provided with another VA PTSD examination in August 2014.
1804539P50S3,,EvidenceSentence,This examiner opined that the Veteran experienced symptoms that met the DSM-V criteria for PTSD that was more likely than not caused by events that occurred during his military service.
1804539P50S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner also opined that the Veteran met the DSM-V criteria for major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission, and that this condition was more likely than not secondary to chronic sleep impairment caused by a combination of his PTSD and untreated sleep apnea."
1804539P50S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Significantly, the examiner later opined that the Veteran's claimed stressor of being attacked in a dark alley while leaving a bar and stabbed in the hand while on shore leave in the Philippines was adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD."
1804539P51S2,,FindingSentence,"Based on a longitudinal review of the record, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for the Veteran's PTSD and major depressive disorder."
1804539P51S3,,EvidenceSentence,"In this case, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran was afforded two VA PTSD examinations during the appeal period."
1804539P51S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Board further observes that one of the VA examiners determined that the Veteran did not meet the full criteria for a PTSD diagnosis.
1804539P51S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Nevertheless, the evidence of record also reflects that the Veteran was provided a medically sound PTSD diagnosis from the August 2014 VA examiner during the pendency of his appeal."
1804539P51S6,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.303, 3.304(f); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet App 319, 321 (2007)."
1804539P51S7,,EvidenceSentence,"Likewise, the August 2014 VA examiner linked the Veteran's current PTSD diagnosis to his claimed stressor of being attacked in a dark alley while leaving a bar and stabbed in the hand while on shore leave in the Philippines."
1804539P51S8,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"Accordingly, the critical issue in this case involves establishing the actual occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor supporting the PTSD diagnosis."
1804539P52S2,,ReasoningSentence,The Veteran is competent to testify about the events he experienced while on active duty in Vietnam.
1804539P52S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran submitted multiple statements that consistently described being stabbed in the hand while in the Philippines."
1804539P52S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, the Veteran's service treatment records included a September 29, 1972, note in which he sought treatment for small lacerations on the right hand while aboard the USS Enterprise (CVN-65)."
1804539P52S5,,EvidenceSentence,"A review of the history of  the USS Enterprise (CVN-65) confirms that the vessel arrived at Naval Air Station Cubi Point for a four-day visit to Subic Bay, Philippines, on September 24, 1972."
1804539P52S6,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran asserts that these lacerations on his right hand were a result of the stabbing.
1804539P52S7,,ReasoningSentence,"As the Veteran's lay statements regarding the assault have been verified with corroborating evidence, including the Veteran's service treatment records and the history of the USS Enterprise (CVN-65), further analysis of whether the Veteran meets the criteria of 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f)(3) is unnecessary."
1804539P53S2,,FindingSentence,"Considering all of the evidence in its entirety and resolving any doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the September 1972 in-service stressor incident has been sufficiently corroborated to provide the credible supporting evidence needed to show that the claimed in-service stressor, required under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f), actually occurred."
1804539P53S3,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102, 3.304(f); see also Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53-56."
1804539P53S4,,FindingSentence,"Given the facts noted above, and resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the criteria for service connection for PTSD with major depressive disorder have been met."
1804539P53S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f).
1804539P54S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In addition to his PTSD diagnosis, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran was diagnosed with major depressive disorder during the appeal period."
1804539P54S3,LegalRuleSentence,FindingSentence,"The Federal Circuit has recognized that separately diagnosed psychiatric conditions can be service connected, but cannot not be separately rated unless they resulted in different manifestations."
1804539P54S4,,CitationSentence,"See Amberman v. Shinseki, 570 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009)."
1804539P54S5,,FindingSentence,"Here, the Board is granting entitlement to service connection for PTSD with major depressive disorder."
1804539P54S6,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"Accordingly, the severity of the Veteran's service-connected PTSD will be evaluated under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders."
1804539P54S7,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130 (2017).
1804539P54S8,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,Symptoms of depression will be considered in that disability rating.
1804539P54S9,,LegalRuleSentence,"In that regard, the Veteran will not be entitled to separate and additional ratings for depression or any similar psychiatric disorder in the present case unless there is evidence that the symptoms can be distinguished between multiples service-connected disabilities, as manifestations of a disability under multiple diagnoses (i.e., pyramiding) is to be avoided under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14."
1804539P54S10,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"That is, the Veteran cannot be compensated twice for the same symptomatology as ""such a result would overcompensate the claimant for the actual impairment of his earning capacity."""
1804539P54S11,,CitationSentence,"Brady v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 203, 206 (1993)."
1804539P55S2,,FindingSentence,"In conclusion, service connection for a psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as PTSD with major depressive disorder, is granted."
1804539P56S1,,Sentence,ORDER
1804539P57S2,,FindingSentence,"New and material evidence having been received, the claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is reopened."
1804539P58S2,,FindingSentence,Entitlement to service connection for PTSD with major depressive disorder is granted.
1804539P59S1,,Sentence,REMAND
1804539P60S2,,Sentence,The Veteran also seeks entitlement to service connection for a chronic headache disorder.
1804539P60S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Unfortunately, the Board finds that additional development must be undertaken before this issue can be adjudicated on the merits."
1804539P61S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran maintains that he developed a chronic headache disorder in service as a result of an October 1971 motor vehicle accident and/or secondary to a chronic sinus condition.
1804539P61S3,,EvidenceSentence,"At his February 2017 Board videoconference hearing, the Veteran testified that he experienced chronic headaches since service."
1804539P61S4,,EvidenceSentence,A review of the Veteran's service treatment records confirms that he frequently sought treatment for headaches.
1804539P61S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Specifically, the Veteran complained of headaches in July 1971, August 1971, March 1972 (lasting over 21/2 weeks), March 1974, February 1976, January 1977, and February 1977."
1804539P62S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran was provided with a VA headaches examination in May 2012, at which time it was established that he experienced characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine headache pain."
1804539P62S3,,EvidenceSentence,"However, the examiner opined that it was less likely than not that a medical nexus between the in-service headaches and the Veteran's current headache symptoms could be established."
1804539P62S4,,EvidenceSentence,"In support of this opinion, the examiner explained that per the Veteran's own report, he has not consulted his doctor for the headache symptoms over the last 40 years."
1804539P62S5,,EvidenceSentence,"As such, the VA examiner found that there was not sufficient evidence to establish a nexus."
1804539P62S6,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner emphasized that the Veteran carried with him no headache diagnosis, although the examiner conceded from the symptoms the Veteran described at the examination, that he may have migraine, tension, and sinus headaches at different times during the year."
1804539P63S2,,ReasoningSentence,The Board finds that the May 2012 VA opinion is inadequate.
1804539P63S3,,CitationSentence,"Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311-12 (2007) (finding that when VA undertakes to either provide an examination or to obtain an opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate); Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39 (2007) (finding a medical examination inadequate where the examiner ""impermissibly ignored the appellant's lay assertions that he had sustained a back injury during service"")."
1804539P63S4,,ReasoningSentence,"The May 2012 VA examination report only made reference to one instance (March 1972) where the Veteran sought treatment for headaches in service; as discussed by the Board previously, the Veteran sought treatment for headaches in service on at least seven occasions."
1804539P63S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, the May 2012 VA examiner failed to consider the Veteran's competent lay statements detailing his symptoms of headaches continuously since service discharge."
1804539P63S6,,EvidenceSentence,"As such, the Veteran should be provided a new VA headaches examination to obtain an opinion which adequately addresses this pertinent evidence."
1804539P64S1,,Sentence,"Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:"
1804539P65S2,,Sentence,1.
1804539P65S3,,EvidenceSentence,Provide the Veteran with a new VA examination to determine the etiology of his current headache disorder.
1804539P65S4,,ReasoningSentence,"The examiner must review the claims file, to include the in-service and post-service medical evidence as well as the Veteran's competent lay statements as to his headache symptoms during service and after service discharge."
1804539P65S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Based on review of the Veteran's claims file as well as findings derived from the examination, the examiner should state whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or greater) that the Veteran's current headache disorder began in service, was caused by service, or is otherwise etiologically related to his military service, to include his in-service symptoms of headaches."
1804539P65S6,,ReasoningSentence,A complete and thorough rationale must be provided for all opinions provided.
1804539P66S2,,Sentence,2.
1804539P66S3,,Sentence,"After completing the above development, and any other development deemed necessary, readjudicate the issue remaining on appeal."
1804539P66S4,,Sentence,"If the benefit sought remains denied, then provide an additional supplemental statement of the case to the Veteran and his representative, and return the appeal to the Board for appellate review, after the Veteran has had an adequate opportunity to respond."
1804539P67S2,,Sentence,The appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.
1804539P67S3,,CitationSentence,"Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999)."
1804539P68S2,,Sentence,This claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.
1804539P68S3,,LegalRuleSentence,The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.
1804539P68S4,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 5109B, 7112 (West 2014)."

1804595P14S1,,Sentence,INTRODUCTION
1804595P15S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran served on active duty from July 2006 to January 2011.
1804595P16S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (hereinafter Board) on appeal from a December 2011 rating decision, by the Lincoln, Nebraska, Regional Office (RO), which granted service connection for PTSD and assigned a 10 percent disability rating, effective January 25, 2011."
1804595P16S3,,Sentence,The Veteran perfected a timely appeal of the rating assigned.
1804595P16S4,,Sentence,"By a rating action in January 2012, the RO confirmed the 10 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD."
1804595P17S2,,Sentence,"In March 2014, the Veteran testified at a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge, sitting at the RO."
1804595P17S3,,Sentence,A transcript of that hearing is of record.
1804595P18S2,,Sentence,"In June 2016, the Board increased the rating for the Veteran's PTSD, and remanded the case to the RO for further evidentiary development."
1804595P18S3,,EvidenceSentence,"A rating decision, dated in June 2016, implemented the Board's decision and assigned a 30 percent rating for PTSD, effective January 25, 2011."
1804595P18S4,,EvidenceSentence,"That, however, was not the highest possible rating, so the appeal continues."
1804595P18S5,,CitationSentence,"See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993)."
1804595P18S6,,EvidenceSentence,A supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) was issued in December 2016.
1804595P19S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In June 2017, the Veteran was notified that the Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) who presided over his March 2014 hearing is no longer employed by the Board, and he was given an opportunity to request a new hearing before a sitting VLJ pursuant to 38 C.F.R. Â§ 20.707  (2017)."
1804595P19S3,,EvidenceSentence,"In July 2017, VA received the Veteran's response that he did not wish to appear at a new hearing, and for the Board to consider his case on the evidence of record."
1804595P20S1,,Sentence,FINDINGS OF FACT
1804595P21S2,,Sentence,1.
1804595P21S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's PTSD is manifested by ongoing symptoms of depression, sleep impairment marked by recurring nightmares, anxiety, irritability, hypervigilance, and social isolation; his psychiatric symptoms result in disability no worse than that causing occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks."
1804595P22S2,,Sentence,2.
1804595P22S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's PTSD does not cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks occurring more frequently than once per week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of long-term memory; impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; difficulty in establishing effective work and social relationships, or symptoms of like kind."
1804595P23S1,,Sentence,CONCLUSION OF LAW
1804595P24S2,,FindingSentence,The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for PTSD have not been met.
1804595P24S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1155, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.21, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411 (2017)."
1804595P25S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION
1804595P26S2,,Sentence,Factual background & Analysis-I/R PTSD.
1804595P27S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran essentially contends that his service-connected PTSD is more disabling than reflected by the currently assigned ratings.
1804595P27S3,,EvidenceSentence,"At his personal hearing in March 2014, the Veteran maintained that he had problems with social interactions; he noted that the November 2011 examiner downplayed his family issues."
1804595P27S4,,EvidenceSentence,"He also reported difficulty getting along with others, which also causes problems with employment."
1804595P27S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran testified that he continued to have problems with being hypervigilant, which caused him to have problems being in crowds."
1804595P27S6,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran indicated that his panic attacks occur maybe once a month.
1804595P27S7,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran reported occasional depression.
1804595P28S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity."
1804595P28S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.
1804595P28S4,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.1.
1804595P28S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment."
1804595P28S6,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.10.
1804595P29S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of the Veteran's disability."

1804595P32S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Under that code, a 30 percent evaluation is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events)."
1804595P33S1,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A rating of 50 percent is assigned where the claimant exhibits occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short-term or long-term memory (e.g. retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships."
1804595P34S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A rating of 70 percent is assigned where the claimant exhibits occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); inability to establish and maintain successful relationships."
1804595P35S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A rating of 100 percent is assigned where the claimant exhibits total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name."

1804595P38S2,,Sentence,"The amendments replace those references with references to the recently updated ""DSM-5,"" and examinations conducted pursuant to the DSM-5 do not include GAF scores."
1804595P39S1,,EvidenceSentence,"A GAF score of 31-40 indicates some impairment in reality testing or communications or major impairment in several areas, such as work or school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood."
1804595P39S2,,EvidenceSentence,"A GAF of 41-50 denotes serious symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe obsessional rituals, frequent shoplifting) OR any serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning."

1804595P41S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In the April 2017 Appellant's Brief, the Veteran, through his representative, contended that his military sexual trauma (MST) was not considered in the evaluation of his service-connected PTSD."
1804595P41S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"As stated above, VA regulations require adjudicators to evaluate PTSD based on the symptoms and the impact of the symptoms on occupational and social functioning."
1804595P42S2,,Sentence,"Historically, the Veteran's initial claim for service connection for PTSD was received in October 2011."
1804595P42S3,,EvidenceSentence,"In a statement in support of claim (VA Form 21-4138), dated in October 2011, the Veteran indicated that he was seeking to establish service connection for PTSD due to MST."
1804595P43S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In conjunction with his claim, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2011, at which time he reported being in Basra which was hit in late 2007 to mid-2008; he noted that they were hit heavily by rockets mortars and other rounds coming through the fence line."
1804595P43S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran indicated that two mortars hit right next to him.
1804595P43S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran also reported being on a recovery team where a Chinook went down and all Army National Guards were killed; he stated that this was a horrible site to see with the crash site .The Veteran related that their main mission was flight recovery to figure out what happened and to bag up the bodies or body parts etc.
1804595P43S5,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted that the Veteran feared and was horrified from the hostile enemy or terrorist activity.
1804595P43S6,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted that Veteran's symptom reporting is consistent with PTSD (by DSM-IV) criteria that is related to his fear of hostile enemy or terrorist activity.
1804595P43S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The diagnosis was PTSD, and he was assigned a GAF score of 60."
1804595P43S8,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner stated that the Veteran's PTSD resulted in occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress or symptoms controlled by medication.
1804595P44S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Submitted in support of the Veteran's claim was a statement of stressors, dated in December 2011, wherein he reported that, during a support mission in Basra, Iraq, the enemy had set up camp outside their base and they were constantly struck with rockets and mortar."
1804595P44S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran also reported that, in August 2010, he and his buddy allowed someone to stay with them and he awoke to find that the man was sexually assaulting him."
1804595P44S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran indicated that he never reported the incident for fear of being punished.
1804595P45S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Also submitted in support of the Veteran's claim were VA progress notes dated from May 2011 to November 2016, which show that the Veteran received ongoing clinical evaluation and treatment for chronic PTSD; he received counseling for his PTSD symptoms."
1804595P45S3,,EvidenceSentence,"A treatment note, dated in May 2011, indicates that the Veteran presented with symptoms consistent with MST and other combat PTSD from OEF/OIF experiences in Iraq and other stressors."
1804595P45S4,,EvidenceSentence,"It was reported that the Veteran had Variable Moderate to Excessive symptoms, including nightmares, occasional disturbing memories, avoiding stimuli, flashbacks, hypervigilance, startling easily, and perimeter securing."
1804595P45S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The assessment was PTSD due to MST & combat, anxiety NOS and depression NOS."
1804595P45S6,,EvidenceSentence,"When seen in August 2016, the Veteran reported that he does have PTSD from combat, but did not remember his nightmares."
1804595P46S1,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was afforded another DBQ examination in November 2016.
1804595P46S2,,EvidenceSentence,"At that time, it was noted that the Veteran's most recent involvement with mental health intervention was in November 2013."
1804595P46S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran indicated that he was no longer taking Doxepin.
1804595P46S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran also reported that he was no longer taking psychiatric medication nor had any involvement with non-VA mental health nor was there intervention through Vet Center.
1804595P46S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran indicated that had a group of colleagues that are Veterans that he plays video games on line, and he worked out three times per week with his wife."
1804595P46S6,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran denied any therapy with non-VA mental health or with Vet. Center.
1804595P46S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner noted that the Veteran's PTSD was manifested by depressed mood, anxiety and chronic sleep impairment."
1804595P46S8,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner stated that the Veteran's PTSD would result in social and occupational impairment with intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks with associated decrease in work efficiency.
1804595P47S2,,FindingSentence,After a careful review of the evidence of record the Board finds that an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for PTSD is not warranted.
1804595P47S3,,EvidenceSentence,PTSD does not result in more than occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks.
1804595P47S4,,ReasoningSentence,"In this regard, the Board notes that, little in the record, including the Veteran's testimony and lay statements, suggest that the criteria for a schedular evaluation in excess of 30 percent are met."
1804595P47S5,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"In reaching its conclusion, the Board has considered the Veteran's statements regarding his PTSD symptoms and their impact on his functioning."
1804595P47S6,,EvidenceSentence,"He described depression and difficulty with crowds, and sleep disturbance."
1804595P47S7,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"However, the evidence as a whole does not demonstrate deficiencies supportive of a 50 percent or higher evaluation."
1804595P47S8,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,There is no indication of obsessional rituals or other disturbance of thought.
1804595P47S9,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,The Veteran is able to communicate appropriately.
1804595P47S10,,EvidenceSentence,"While mood disturbance is evident, the Veteran is not shown to suffer from disturbances of motivation and mood that result in reduced reliability and productivity."
1804595P47S11,,EvidenceSentence,"It is noteworthy that, following the DBQ examination in November 2011, the examiner stated that the Veteran's PTSD resulted in mild or transient symptoms."
1804595P47S12,,EvidenceSentence,"In November 2016, the examiner stated that the Veteran's PTSD would lead to intermittent periods of inability to perform tasks with associated decrease in work efficiency."
1804595P47S13,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner related that there was no impairment in the Veteran's ability to understand and carry out short simple instructions, no impairment to understand and carry out complex instructions, no impairment exercising judgment in a work place, no impairment in adapting to stressful work circumstances, and no impairment in his ability to effectively relate to coworkers, supervisors and general public."
1804595P48S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"In conclusion, the overall disability picture does not approach the criteria for a schedular evaluation of 50 percent or higher."
1804595P48S3,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The objective record does not demonstrate that the Veteran's documented deficiencies in occupational performance, social interaction, and mood are more consistent with the criteria for a higher evaluation."
1804595P48S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Rather, as noted, competent examiners have concluded that the Veteran's symptoms are productive of no more than an occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks."
1804595P48S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, the Veteran himself does not describe symptoms that are productive of more than an occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods during which he is unable to perform occupational tasks."
1804595P48S6,FindingSentence,ReasoningSentence,"As such, the Board concludes that the Veteran's overall disability picture is best approximated by a 30 percent evaluation."
1804595P48S7,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"In sum, the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's symptoms do not cause occupational and social impairment of the severity contemplated by the criteria for a 50 percent evaluation."
1804595P48S8,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,The GAF scores assigned during the appeal period support no higher than a 30 percent evaluation.
1804595P49S2,,FindingSentence,"Accordingly, the Board concludes that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim of entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for PTSD, and the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply."

1804595P51S2,,Sentence,Extraschedular Consideration.
1804595P52S1,,Sentence,The Board has considered whether referral for an extraschedular rating is warranted for the relevant periods on appeal.
1804595P52S2,,ReasoningSentence,The Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms are contemplated both in kind and degree by the scheduler criteria.
1804595P52S3,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,Neither the facts of the case nor the Veteran's allegations raise the issue of extraschedular consideration.
1804595P52S4,FindingSentence,Sentence,"Thus, no analysis is required."
1804595P52S5,,CitationSentence,"See Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484, 494 (2016) (holding that an extraschedular analysis is not warranted where it is not ""specifically sought by the claimant nor reasonably raised by the facts found by the Board"") (citing Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 499 (2006), aff'd, 226 Fed. Appx.1004 (Fed. Cir. 2007)."
1804595P52S6,CitationSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"See also Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369 (2017) (explaining that the Board had no obligation to analyze whether referral is warranted for extraschedular consideration if an extraschedular rating is not specifically sought by the claimant or reasonably raised by the facts found by the Board)."
1804595P53S2,,FindingSentence,"In this case, the Veteran has not submitted evidence of unemployability specifically due to his service-connected PTSD."
1804595P53S3,,EvidenceSentence,"As noted above, while it was noted that the Veteran has not been employed snice his discharge from service, the evidence does not demonstrate that this was due to PTSD or that he is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation."
1804595P53S4,,EvidenceSentence,"In fact, following a review of the claims folder, in December 2011, a VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's PTSD in and of itself would not render the Veteran incapable of physical or sedentary employment."
1804595P53S5,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner further noted that the Veteran's PTSD in combination with medical issues as noted by Dr Wittowski would not render him incapable of maintaining gainful employment either sedentary or physical.
1804595P53S6,FindingSentence,ReasoningSentence,"As such, the evidence of record is against a finding that his PTSD rendered him unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation at any time on appeal."
1804595P53S7,,ReasoningSentence,"In this regard, the treatment reports and examination reports provide sufficient evidence for the Board to conclude that his PTSD did not render him unemployable during any period on appeal."
1804595P53S8,,FindingSentence,"Thus, entitlement to TDIU is not warranted."
1804595P54S2,FindingSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"In summary, the Board concludes that a disability rating higher than 30 percent is not approximated for any period on appeal and that the preponderance of the evidence is against granting a rating higher than 30 percent or TDIU and against remanding for referral for consideration of an extraschedular rating under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.321 (b) for any other period on appeal."
1804595P54S3,FindingSentence,Sentence,There is no reasonable doubt to resolve in this case.
1804595P54S4,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C. Â§ 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102, 4.3."
1804595P55S1,,Sentence,ORDER
1804595P56S2,,Sentence,Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for PTSD is denied.

1805000P14S1,,Sentence,INTRODUCTION
1805000P15S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran had active military service from May 1970 to December 1971.
1805000P16S2,,Sentence,"This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following Board Remands in March 2011, May 2014, and February 2016."
1805000P16S3,,EvidenceSentence,"This matter was originally on appeal from a November 2007 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) in Huntington, West Virginia."
1805000P17S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In January 2011, the Veteran testified at a videoconference hearing."

1805000P20S2,,FindingSentence,"During the entire appeal period, it is as likely as not, that the Veteran's PTSD has been manifested by occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas; it has not been manifested by total occupational and social impairment."

1805000P22S2,,FindingSentence,"With resolution of reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, during the entire appeal period, the criteria for an evaluation of 70 percent, but no higher, have been met."

1805000P23S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION
1805000P24S2,,Sentence,Preliminary Matters
1805000P25S2,,Sentence,"Pursuant to the Board's February 2016 Remand, the Appeals Management Center (AMC) obtained an opinion assessing the severity of the Veteran's PTSD, readjudicated the claim, and issued a Supplemental Statement of the Case."
1805000P25S3,,FindingSentence,"Based on the foregoing actions, the Board finds that there has been compliance with the Board's February 2016 Remand."
1805000P25S4,,CitationSentence,"Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998)."
1805000P26S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"As provided for by the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits."
1805000P26S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (2012); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2017)."
1805000P26S4,FindingSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"As service connection, an initial rating, and an effective date have been assigned, the notice requirements of 38 U.S.C. Â§ 5103(a) have been met."
1805000P27S2,FindingSentence,Sentence,"VA has fulfilled its duty to assist the Veteran in obtaining identified and available evidence needed to substantiate a claim, and as warranted by law, affording VA examinations."
1805000P27S3,,EvidenceSentence,He was provided the opportunity to present pertinent evidence and testimony.
1805000P27S4,,ReasoningSentence,"Moreover, during the January 2011 Board hearing, the undersigned explained the issues on appeal and asked questions designed to elicit evidence that may have been overlooked with regard to the claim."
1805000P27S5,,Sentence,"These actions provided an opportunity for the Veteran and his representative to introduce material evidence and pertinent arguments, in compliance with 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.103(c)(2) and consistent with the duty to assist."
1805000P27S6,,ReasoningSentence,"In sum, there is no evidence of any VA error in notifying or assisting him that reasonably affects the fairness of this adjudication."
1805000P27S7,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.159(c).
1805000P28S2,,Sentence,Increased Rating
1805000P29S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity."
1805000P29S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.
1805000P29S4,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.1.
1805000P29S5,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned."
1805000P29S6,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.7.
1805000P30S2,,Sentence,The Veteran is appealing the original assignment of a disability evaluation following an award of service connection for PTSD.
1805000P30S3,,ReasoningSentence,"As such, it is not the present level of disability which is of primary importance, but rather the entire period is to be considered to ensure that consideration is given to the possibility of staged ratings; that is, separate ratings for separate periods of time based on the facts found."
1805000P30S4,,CitationSentence,"Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999)."
1805000P31S2,EvidenceSentence,CitationSentence,"The Veteran's PTSD has been rated as 30 percent disabling prior to April 23, 2011,  50 percent disabling from April 23, 2011 to November 23, 2014, and 70 percent disabling from November 24, 2014, under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, 38 C.F.R.

1805000P65S10,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner stated, ""Based on my interview and exper[ie]nce with this vet his symptoms remain stable."
1805000P65S11,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"There is no evidence of worsening in symptom[ato]logy."""
1805000P65S12,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner noted that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms were manifested by depressed mood, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships."

1805000P66S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In July 2016, a VA addendum opinion was obtained at which time the examiner, a VA psychiatrist, noted that the assigned GAF was presumed to be:  ""equal to 45 for PTSD"" which is the GAF that was assigned in 2011 and for which the 2014 exam stated:  ""Based on my interview and exper[ie]nce with this vet his symptoms remain stable."
1805000P66S3,,EvidenceSentence,"There is no evidence of worsening in symptom[ato]logy,"" which this current examiner interprets as that the previous GAF remains stable and unchanged."
1805000P66S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner also noted that the 2011 examiner stated that the alcohol disorder was a result of the PTSD, that the 2014 examiner did not address separate psychiatric diagnoses."

1805000P67S2,,EvidenceSentence,The veteran's current problem list in CPRS since 2015 list only PTSD and no alcohol or depression.
1805000P67S3,EvidenceSentence,ReasoningSentence,"It can only be assumed, since the veteran has not received any care for his PTSD, depression, or alcohol since 2011 that the only standing diagnosis at this time is continued PTSD and alcohol use, since the veteran disclosed an unchanged amount of daily alcohol use (""I never miss a happy hour"")."
1805000P67S4,,EvidenceSentence,"It would be assume from the 2011 exam that all psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms are a result of PTSD, since this was the 2011 examiner's determination."
1805000P68S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Board also notes that the Veteran's PTSD symptom severity has fluctuated during the appeal period which included recurrent intrusive thoughts of traumatic experience, recurrent nightmares, irritability, hypervigilance, depressed and anxious mood, avoidance of events/stimuli associated with traumatic event, guilt feelings."
1805000P68S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's symptoms also included poor sleep and being withdrawn and isolative.
1805000P69S2,,EvidenceSentence,It appears at first glance that the Veteran had no deficiency with respect to family relations.
1805000P69S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Although the Veteran reported interpersonal relationship problems resulting in five marriages, the Veteran consistently indicated that he had a happy and stable marriage and received support from his wife."
1805000P69S4,,EvidenceSentence,"In September 2006, the Veteran also reported that he had one parent living, his father, two brothers, and 2 sisters and that he had good support system from his family."

1805000P69S6,,EvidenceSentence,"In October 2008, the Veteran reported that one of his brothers with whom he did not have a good relationship came visited for the first time; they had a good visit and discovered they had a lot in common."
1805000P69S7,,EvidenceSentence,"In addition, it appears that the Veteran had friends that he spent time with including gulfing occasionally and drinking."
1805000P70S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Despite his reports of good relationships, the Veteran has consistently indicated that he mostly stayed to himself, that he belonged to no clubs or organization, and did not attend church."
1805000P70S3,,EvidenceSentence,"In January 2011, the Veteran reported that he had no social interactions and about the only person that he trusted was his wife."
1805000P70S4,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner who conducted the April 2010 and April 2011 VA examinations noted in April 2010 that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms affected him socially and were at least moderate at that time and noted in April 2011 that the Veteran's social capacity was severely affected as far as social relationships were concerned related to PTSD.
1805000P71S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Although the Veteran was able to work during the appeal period until his retirement in 2011, the medical professionals indicated that it was possible because he worked alone and that working kept his mind occupied suggesting that the Veteran would have suffered more distress from his PTSD had he not been working."
1805000P71S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Even so, the Veteran reported at the October 2007 VA examination that his nervousness, anxiety, and irritability were affecting his job."
1805000P71S4,,EvidenceSentence,The April 2011 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's industrial impairment was moderate to severe but that he was able to hold onto his job because he worked by himself.
1805000P72S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In addition, although the Veteran's judgment was noted to be fair on VA examination in October 2007, noted to be intact on VA examinations in April 2010 and April 2011, the Veteran was noted to suffer from alcohol addiction."
1805000P72S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Although the VA examinations have demonstrated no cognitive impairment, the Veteran reported problems with concentration."
1805000P72S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Although the April 2010 and April 2011 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's major depressive disorder was attributable to nonservice-connected disorders, the October 2007 examiner found that the Veteran was showing features of PTSD manifesting in the form of, inter alia, depression."
1805000P72S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The VA psychiatrist in July 2016 found the since the 2011 examination, all psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms, which included depressed mood, could be assumed to be the result of PTSD."
1805000P73S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Finally, the Board notes that the Veteran's GAF scores assigned during the entire appeal period ranged from 45 to 55."
1805000P73S3,,EvidenceSentence,"GAFs of 45 were assigned in August 2007, August 2009, January 2011, on VA examination in April 2011, and by the VA psychiatrist in July 2016 for the November 2014 examination."
1805000P73S4,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board notes that GAF scores are not, in and of themselves, the dispositive element in rating a disability; rather they must be considered in light of the actual symptoms of the Veteran's disorder, which provide the primary basis for the rating assigned."
1805000P73S5,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.126 (a) (2017).
1805000P73S6,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Nevertheless, the GAF scores assigned between 45 and 50 indicate serious symptoms or serious impairment in social or occupational functioning and are consistent with the Veteran's PTSD symptomatology."
1805000P74S2,,FindingSentence,"Thus, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that during the entire appeal period, the Veteran's PTSD has been productive of occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most area including work, judgment, thinking and mood."
1805000P74S3,FindingSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Therefore, the Veteran's symptoms due to PTSD during the entire appeal period exceeded the criteria for the 30 and 50 percent ratings and more nearly approximated the criteria for the 70 percent rating."
1805000P75S2,,EvidenceSentence,"There, however, has not been any indication of gross impairment in thought processes or communication, persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, persistent danger of hurting himself or others, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, disorientation as to time or place, or memory loss for names of close relative, own occupation or own name."
1805000P75S3,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms have not exceeded the criteria for a 70-percent rating."
1805000P75S4,FindingSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The criteria for a 100 percent rating are met when the veteran experiences total occupational and social impairment, which is clearly not demonstrated in this case."
1805000P76S2,,FindingSentence,"Upon consideration of all of the relevant evidence of record, the Board finds that during the entire appeal period, the Veterans PTSD has been manifested by occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas; and that at no time during the appeal period has the Veteran's PTSD been manifested by total occupational and social impairment."
1805000P77S1,,Sentence,ORDER
1805000P78S2,,Sentence,"Entitlement to an initial evaluation of 70 percent, but no higher, for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and episodic alcohol abuse is granted subject to the law and regulations governing the payment of monetary benefits."

1805403P33S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria established in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based upon the average impairment of earning capacity."
1805403P33S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,Individual disabilities are assigned separate Diagnostic Codes.

1805403P33S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular Diagnostic Code (DC), the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned."

1805403P33S7,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,Consideration must be given to increased evaluations under other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes.

1805403P33S9,,LegalRuleSentence,"Furthermore, when it is not possible to separate the effects of the service-connected disability from a nonservice-connected condition, such signs and symptoms must be attributed to the service-connected disability."
1805403P33S10,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.102 (2017); Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181, 182 (1998)."

1805403P33S12,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.3 (2017).
1805403P34S2,,LegalRuleSentence,Staged ratings are appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.
1805403P34S3,,CitationSentence,"Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (citing Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999))."
1805403P34S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"In a claim for a greater original rating after an initial award of service connection, all of the evidence submitted in support of the Veteran's claim is to be considered."

1805403P35S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Pyramiding, that is the evaluation of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when evaluating a veteran's service-connected disability."
1805403P35S3,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14 (2017); see Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261- 62 (1994)."
1805403P36S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A 70 percent rating is prescribed when there is evidence of occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships."

1805403P38S2,,ReasoningSentence,"The list of symptoms under the rating criteria are meant to be examples of symptoms that would warrant the rating, but are not meant to be exhaustive, and the Board need not find all or even some of the symptoms to award a specific rating."
1805403P38S3,,CitationSentence,"Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442-3 (2002)."
1805403P38S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"However, a veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating under Â§ 4.130 by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration, and that such symptoms have resulted in the type of occupational and social impairment associated with that percentage."

1805403P39S6,,ReasoningSentence,"Third, the Board must weigh the probative value of the proffered evidence in light of the entirety of the record."
1805403P40S2,,LegalRuleSentence,A veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.

1805403P40S5,,CitationSentence,"See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990); see also Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 532 (2014)."

1805403P43S9,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner also stated the Veteran would frequently decompensate when subjected to normal pressures and constructive criticisms of a job.
1805403P44S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"In September 2015, one of the Veteran's mental health examiners submitted an updated mental health assessment of the Veteran."
1805403P44S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran reported he was having symptoms of intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, depersonalization, and isolation from friends and family."
1805403P44S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran also stated he had anger against his mother surfacing.
1805403P44S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran reported an auto accident in July 2009 that left him with confusion, memory problems, severe anxiety, and flashbacks to his first auto accident."
1805403P44S6,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted the Veteran's medical records did not indicate that any actual damage had been done to the Veteran's brain.
1805403P44S7,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted the Veteran was appropriately dressed with moderate eye contact and rapport.
1805403P44S8,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner stated the Veteran did not report suicidal or homicidal ideations.
1805403P45S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In August 2017, the Veteran's spouse submitted another statement, detailing daily life living with the Veteran and his PTSD."
1805403P45S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's spouse stated the Veteran lived in a hotel for several months so he could cope with his PTSD symptoms.
1805403P45S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's spouse reported that the Veteran's PTSD limited his ability to functionally interact appropriately and affectively from day to day.
1805403P45S5,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's spouse reported the Veteran spoke to her about suicidal ideations and experienced a lot of anxiety and panic.
1805403P45S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Sometimes, the Veteran's spouse reported, the Veteran would say things that were inappropriate out of nervousness."
1805403P45S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's spouse stated the Veteran lacked focus and could become frustrated, leading to arguments and that he struggled to remember things and was not able to control his emotions."
1805403P46S2,,Sentence,C.  Analysis
1805403P47S2,,CitationSentence,"The Veteran's PTSD is currently evaluated as 70 percent disabling beginning March 30, 2012 pursuant to 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130, DC 9411 (2017)."
1805403P48S2,FindingSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The medical evidence, combined with the Veteran's and his spouse's subjective reports of his symptoms, indicates that the severity level of his PTSD warrants no more than a 70 percent rating."
1805403P48S3,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"In this regard, the Veteran's PTSD was productive of occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; impaired impulse control, spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances; and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships."
1805403P48S4,,FindingSentence,The evidence does not show the Veteran's PTSD is productive of total occupational and social impairment.
1805403P48S5,,EvidenceSentence,"While the Veteran's spouse reported the Veteran sometimes struggled with his memory, had suicidal ideations, and sometimes said inappropriate things, she did say the Veteran was able to interact with her and did not indicate the Veteran was totally impaired due to his PTSD."
1805403P48S6,,ReasoningSentence,"Additionally, the other evidence of record does not indicate the Veteran to be totally occupationally and social impaired due to his PTSD."
1805403P49S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"The Board has considered the Veteran's statements regarding the severity of his PTSD symptoms, including his statements that he had to miss work due to his mental health."
1805403P49S3,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran contends that PTSD is far more disabling than the ratings he was assigned and the Veteran is competent to report the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.
1805403P49S4,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C.Â§ 1153 (a); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303 (a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006)."
1805403P49S5,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Ultimately, however, the opinions and observations of the Veteran do not meet the burden for a higher rating imposed by the rating criteria under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.71a with respect to determining the severity of his PTSD because the Veteran's statements, along with the objective evidence, do not tend to show that he is totally socially and occupationally disabled."
1805403P49S6,,FindingSentence,"The preponderance of the medical and subjective evidence does not show that symptomatology associated with the Veteran's PTSD more nearly approximates the schedular criteria associated with the next higher, 100 percent rating."
1805403P49S7,FindingSentence,Sentence,"Therefore, an increased rating in excess of 70 percent disabling is denied."
1805403P50S2,,Sentence,The Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.
1805403P50S3,,FindingSentence,"Because the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply."
1805403P50S4,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C. Â§5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57(1990)."

1805403P55S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.155 (a).
1805403P56S2,,Sentence,B.  Analysis
1805403P57S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"The Veteran first submitted his informal claim for service connection for PTSD on March 30, 2012."
1805403P57S3,,FindingSentence,"After reviewing the totality of the evidence, the Board finds that VA did not receive an application for service connection for PTSD prior to that date, nor is there any indication from the Veteran that he intended to file a claim for PTSD prior to that date."
1805403P58S2,,ReasoningSentence,"While the Board finds the Veteran both competent and credible to discuss his conditions, the record does not contain a previously filed claim, formal or informal, for PTSD."
1805403P58S3,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"Even if the Veteran had sought medical treatment for PTSD prior to March 30, 2012, medical treatment in of itself does not establish a claim for service connection."
1805403P58S4,,CitationSentence,"See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998); see also Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999)"
1805403P59S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran separated from service in June 1972.
1805403P59S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Under 38 C.F.R. Â§3.400 for direct service connection, the effective date is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service."
1805403P59S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"The effective date for presumptive service connection is the date the entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from active duty."
1805403P59S5,,FindingSentence,"However, the Veteran did not file his claim within one year of separation from service."
1805403P59S6,,Sentence,"Therefore, the effective date for his PTSD claim remains the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later."
1805403P59S7,,FindingSentence,"While sympathetic to the Veteran's belief that an earlier effective date is warranted, for the reasons outlined above, the Board is precluded by law from assigning an effective date prior to March 30, 2012 for the grant of service connection for PTSD."
1805403P59S8,,FindingSentence,"Because no claim was filed prior to March 30, 2012 and because the Veteran did not file his service connection for PTSD within one year of his separation from service, the claim must be denied."
1805403P60S2,,Sentence,The Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.
1805403P60S3,,FindingSentence,"Because the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply."
1805403P60S4,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C. Â§5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57(1990)."

1805403P62S2,,Sentence,A.  Legal Criteria
1805403P63S2,,LegalRuleSentence,Entitlement to a TDIU requires the presence of impairment so severe that it is impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.
1805403P63S3,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"Consideration may be given to the veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his age or to the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities."
1805403P63S4,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§ 1155 (2012); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.19 (2017)."
1805403P63S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is ""whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability."""

1805403P63S7,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,The fact that a veteran is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough to warrant a TDIU.
1805403P63S8,,CitationSentence,"See Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App 361."
1805403P64S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"The law provides that a total disability rating may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, or if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more."
1805403P64S3,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(a) (2017).
1805403P65S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Where these criteria are not met, but the Veteran is nevertheless unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities, VA shall submit the case to the Director of Compensation Service for consideration as to whether a TDIU may be awarded on an extraschedular basis."

1805403P73S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In May 2016, the Veteran submitted an opinion from a vocational consultant."
1805403P73S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The consultant reviewed the Veteran's file and opined, based upon her review of the evidence, that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD and back condition rendered him unable to perform work at a substantially gainful level."

1805403P74S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran added that he had worked as a turbine room operator full-time from May 1972 to September 1988, which was the date he last worked and the date he said he became too disabled to work."

18100017P15S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
18100017P16S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran served on active duty from October 1967 to October 1971, to include service in the Republic of Korea."
18100017P17S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran testified at a videoconference hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in November 2016.
18100017P17S3,,Sentence,A transcript of the hearing is of record.
18100017P18S2,,Sentence,
18100017P19S2,,Sentence,Whether new and material evidence has been received to reopen the claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
18100017P20S2,,Sentence,The VeteranÂ’s initial claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD was denied in an October 2008 rating decision.
18100017P21S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Generally, if a claim of entitlement to service connection has been previously denied and that decision became final, the claim can be reopened and reconsidered only if new and material evidence is presented with respect to that claim."
18100017P21S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 5108.
18100017P22S2,,LegalRuleSentence,New evidence is defined as existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decision makers.
18100017P22S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Material evidence means evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim."
18100017P22S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"New and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence previously of record, and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim."
18100017P22S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.156(a).
18100017P22S6,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,The threshold to reopen the claim is low.
18100017P22S7,,CitationSentence,"See Shade v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 110, 118 (2010)."
18100017P23S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"For the purpose of establishing whether new and material evidence has been received, the credibility of the evidence is generally presumed."
18100017P23S3,,CitationSentence,"Justus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 513 (1992)."
18100017P24S2,Sentence,FindingSentence,"The RO denied the VeteranÂ’s claim for service connection for PTSD in an October 2008 rating decision, finding insufficient evidence to establish both a diagnosis of PTSD and that the disability was related to the VeteranÂ’s asserted in-service stressors."
18100017P24S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was provided notice of this decision and his appellate rights that same month.
18100017P24S4,Sentence,FindingSentence,The Veteran did not appeal the October 2008 decision or submit material evidence within one year of the notification of the decision.
18100017P24S5,,Sentence,"Therefore, the decision is final."
18100017P24S6,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C. Â§ 7104 (2002); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.156, 20.302, 20.1103 (2008)."
18100017P25S2,,ReasoningSentence,The Board finds that the evidence received since the October 2008 rating decision includes evidence that is both new and material to the claims.
18100017P25S3,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.156.
18100017P25S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Specifically, this evidence includes VA treatment records indicating a history of PTSD diagnosed by VA providers and the VeteranÂ’s November 2016 hearing testimony."
18100017P25S5,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"In addition, the VeteranÂ’s VA Form 9 substantive appeal contains information pertaining to the establishment of an in-service stressor."
18100017P25S6,,FindingSentence,"The new evidence raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim as it addresses both a diagnosis of PTSD for service connection purposes and that the disability is related to an in-service stressor, and therefore addresses reasons for the previous denial."
18100017P25S7,,FindingSentence,Such evidence is presumed credible solely for the purpose of determining whether new and material evidence has been submitted.
18100017P25S8,,CitationSentence,"See Justus, 3 Vet. App. at 513."
18100017P26S2,,Sentence,"Accordingly, the claim for service connection for PTSD is reopened and will be considered on the merits."
18100017P27S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In evaluating the evidence and rendering a decision on the merits, the Board is required to assess the credibility and probative value of proffered evidence in the context of the record as a whole, and the Justus presumption of credibility no longer attaches."

1813552P58S3,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The Board has considered the private evaluation from J.F., LICSW, the VA treatment records, and the VA examination report, as well as the Veteran's competent statements regarding the impact of his PTSD on his occupational and social impairment."

1813552P59S3,FindingSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The Board finds that the frequency, duration, and severity of the symptoms more nearly approximate occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity consistent with the assigned 50 percent disability rating."

1813552P60S11,,EvidenceSentence,"The Board notes that from June 18, 2012 to April 25, 2013, the Veteran was capable of interacting appropriately with others."
1813552P60S12,,ReasoningSentence,"As such, the Veteran's level of social impairment does not support a finding of deficiencies in most areas as required by the 70 percent rating criteria."
1813552P61S2,,EvidenceSentence,"With regard to occupational impairment, the July 2012 VA examiner stated that the Veteran had retired from his job."
1813552P61S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran stated that he was unable to secure another job either due to his age or his qualification.
1813552P61S4,,ReasoningSentence,"From June 18, 2012 to April 25, 2013, the Veteran's level of occupational impairment does not support a finding of deficiencies in most areas as required by the 70 percent rating criteria."
1813552P62S2,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board notes that the Veteran endorsed some symptoms listed in the rating criteria for a 70 percent disability rating, such as suicidal ideation and irritation."

1813552P64S3,,EvidenceSentence,"J.F., LICSW noted that the Veteran was jailed for his irritability and angry outbursts, in the past."

1813552P64S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Also, in his November 2012 Vet Center notes, the Veteran stated that he was in a good mood and as happy as can be, did not report any problems whatsoever, and was more cooperative with the examiner."
1813552P64S6,,ReasoningSentence,The Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms are contemplated by a 50 percent rating and do not more nearly approximate deficiencies in most areas as required by a 70 percent rating.
1813552P65S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The evidence also demonstrates that during the relevant period, the Veteran was assessed GAF scores of 40 and 50."
1813552P65S3,,ReasoningSentence,"While VA is to consider an examiner's classification of the level of psychiatric impairment by a GAF score, a GAF score alone is not determinative of the percentage rating to be assigned."

1813552P65S6,,FindingSentence,"The Board finds the totality of the medical and lay evidence of record indicates the Veteran's PTSD symptoms did not result in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, to warrant a disability rating in excess of 50 percent."
1813552P65S7,,CitationSentence,See C.F.R. Â§ 4.130.

1813552P82S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran stated that his PTSD symptoms have gotten worse.
1813552P82S4,,EvidenceSentence,He stated that he had suicidal ideations sometimes on a daily basis.
1813552P82S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, he had persistent visual hallucinations and memory loss."
1813552P83S2,,ReasoningSentence,"Upon careful review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that from April 25, 2013, the objective medical evidence, and the Veteran's statements regarding his symptomatology more nearly approximate symptoms associated with a 70 percent disability rating."
1813552P83S3,,FindingSentence,"In other words, resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that from April 25, 2013, the evidence supports a 70 percent rating."
1813552P83S4,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§ 5107; Gilbert, supra; Mauerhan, supra."
1813552P84S2,,ReasoningSentence,The Board notes that there have been some instances when the Veteran's PTSD was not quite as severe.
1813552P84S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"However, VA will handle cases affected by change in medical findings or diagnosis so as to produce the greatest degree of stability of disability evaluations consistent with the laws and regulations governing disability compensation and pension."
1813552P84S4,,CitationSentence,See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.344(a).
1813552P84S5,,FindingSentence,"As such, the Board finds that the 70 percent rating for PTSD pursuant to Diagnostic Code 9411 is warranted from April 25, 2013."
1813552P85S2,,FindingSentence,"The Board finds, however, that a disability rating greater than 70 percent is not appropriate for any period of time on appeal because the Veteran does not have total social and occupational impairment."
1813552P85S3,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"During the entire period, the Veteran's PTSD has been manifested by symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment and nightmares, flattened affect, hypervigilance, some memory impairment, some suicidal ideation with no intent, irritability, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, all resulting in deficiencies in most areas, but less than total social and occupational impairment."
1813552P86S2,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Although the Veteran clearly has a serious disability, he exhibits few of the symptoms noted as applicable for a 100 percent rating."
1813552P86S3,,EvidenceSentence,"There has been no indication of gross impairment of thought processes or communication, persistent danger of hurting self or others, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, disorientation to time or place, or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name."
1813552P87S2,,EvidenceSentence,The medical evidence of record does not indicate that the Veteran is a persistent danger of harm to himself or others.
1813552P87S3,,EvidenceSentence,The evidence of record does indicate that the Veteran has experienced periods of suicidal ideation.
1813552P87S4,,EvidenceSentence,"For example, during his Board hearing, the Veteran admitted to sometimes daily suicidal thoughts."
1813552P87S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran also stated that he considered going into the garage, getting drunk, and starting the cars and never waking up."
1813552P87S6,,EvidenceSentence,"In this regard, he denied a plan or intent to harm himself or others, noting that he would never do it because of his family."
1813552P87S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's daughter indicated that the Veteran started fist fights with his son, his wife and the dog."
1813552P87S8,,EvidenceSentence,"However, during his April 2013 VA examination, the Veteran denied problems with domestic violence."
1813552P87S9,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, the October 2015 VA examiner stated that the Veteran should not be considered a current imminent risk or increased current imminent risk."
1813552P87S10,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"As such, his symptoms appear to more nearly approximate those for a 70 percent rating, specifically suicidal or homicidal ideation, but without rising to the level required for a 100 percent rating, specifically a persistent danger of hurting self or others."
1813552P88S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, although the evidence of record suggests some memory and cognitive problems, the Veteran has never forgotten the names of close relatives or his own name."
1813552P88S3,,EvidenceSentence,He has also always been oriented at least times three.
1813552P88S4,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"As such, his symptoms appear to more nearly approximate those for a 70 percent rating."
1813552P89S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In April 2013, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran had mild problems with appropriate hygiene."
1813552P89S3,,EvidenceSentence,"However, during his Idaho CBOC examination, the Veteran was described as being casually dress and fairly groomed."
1813552P89S4,,EvidenceSentence,"During his October 2014 and June 2015 examinations with Dr. P, the Veteran was described as being neatly dressed and well-groomed."
1813552P89S5,,FindingSentence,"The Board finds that the frequency, duration, and severity of the symptoms more nearly approximate occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas."
1813552P90S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Finally, the Board acknowledges that during the appeal period, the Veteran's GAF scores were 50, suggesting serious symptoms."
1813552P90S3,FindingSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The Board finds that the evidence of record indicates that such problems adversely affect his social and occupational functioning to warrant a 70 percent disability rating, but no higher."
1813552P91S2,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"For these reasons, the evidence of record indicates the Veteran has social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, including social and family relations, but not total social impairment, commensurate with a 70 percent rating, but no higher."
1813552P91S3,FindingSentence,CitationSentence,"Although the Veteran may meet some of the criteria for a 100 percent rating, see Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 442, the Board concludes his overall level of disability does not exceed a 70 percent rating."
1813552P92S2,FindingSentence,Sentence,"The Board has considered the Veteran's claim and the lay and medical evidence, and concludes the evidence of record more nearly approximates the criteria for a 70 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD from April 25, 2013 to the present."

1813552P94S4,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,A finding of total disability is appropriate when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.

1813552P95S3,,CitationSentence,"See Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356, 358 (1991) (adding that the definition of substantially gainful employment suggests a living wage)."
1813552P95S4,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,Marginal employment is not considered substantially gainful employment.

1813552P98S2,,ReasoningSentence,"A TDIU claim presupposes that the rating for the service-connected condition is less than 100 percent, and only asks for TDIU because of subjective factors that the objective rating does not consider."
1813552P98S3,,CitationSentence,"See Vettese v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 31, 34-35 (1994)."
1813552P98S4,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"Thus, in evaluating a veteran's employability, consideration may be given to his level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his age or to impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities."
1813552P98S5,,CitationSentence,"See 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.341(a), 4.16, 4.19."
1813552P99S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,The sole fact that a claimant is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough.
1813552P99S3,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment.
1813552P99S4,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The ultimate question, however, is whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment."

1813552P105S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"The veteran's service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment, and all other factors having a bearing on the issue must be addressed."
1813552P105S7,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(b).
1813552P106S2,,ReasoningSentence,"When considering the Veteran's service-connected disability, its impact on his occupational functioning, and factors such as his employment and education history, the evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran's service-connected disability rendered him unemployable."
1813552P106S3,,FindingSentence,"As such, the Board finds that referral of the Veteran's case to the VA Director of Compensation Service for extraschedular consideration is not warranted."
1813552P106S4,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(b).
1813552P107S2,EvidenceSentence,FindingSentence,Review of the evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran has a high school diploma.
1813552P107S3,,EvidenceSentence,"During his July 2012 VA examination, the Veteran's symptoms included mild memory loss, irritability, chronic sleep impairment, depressed mood, and panic attacks that occur weekly or less often."
1813552P107S4,,EvidenceSentence,"However, during his spare time, the Veteran socialized with his neighbor, helped his group members and met them once a month for coffee."
1813552P107S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, the Veteran performed significant repairs on his house."
1813552P107S6,,EvidenceSentence,"For many years, the Veteran had an alcohol abuse problem, but at the time of the examination, the problem was in remission."
1813552P107S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran stated that from 1991 to 2009, he worked for three different companies as a cement mixer driver."
1813552P107S8,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran stated that he had conflicts with co-workers.
1813552P107S9,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, while making deliveries, he got lost three times and his employer gave him a warning."
1813552P107S10,,EvidenceSentence,"After getting lost for a third time, he resigned in lieu of waiting to be fired."
1813552P107S11,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran stated that he applied for seven or eight jobs but believed that due to his age or lack of qualifications, he was unable to secure a position."
1813552P108S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In September 2012, a SSA Administrative Judge concluded that the Veteran was not disabled for SSA purposes."
1813552P108S3,,CitationSentence,See Disability Determination and Transmittal entered in Caseflow Reader in July 2012 at 12.
1813552P108S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner stated that regarding the Veteran's PTSD symptoms, he continued to make improvements and would be able to perform less demanding work."
1813552P108S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Regarding his memory, the examiner noted that the Veteran's ability to remember locations and work-like procedures was not significantly limited."
1813552P108S6,,CitationSentence,See id. at 8.
1813552P109S2,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"While the Board acknowledges the Veteran's service-connected disabilities may cause occupational impairment, in order for the Veteran to prevail on a claim for TDIU on an extra-schedular basis, the record must reflect some factors that take his case outside the norm."
1813552P109S3,,CitationSentence,"See Van Hoose, supra; see also 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.321(a), 4.1 (the rating schedule represents as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from the service-connected disability and its residual conditions in civil occupations)."
1813552P109S4,,FindingSentence,The Board finds the evidence does not establish that the Veteran is in a different position than other veterans with a similar combined disability rating.
1813552P109S5,,CitationSentence,"See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(a); see also Van Hoose, supra."
1813552P110S2,,ReasoningSentence,The Board notes that VA is required to consider the SSA's findings.
1813552P110S3,,Sentence,"However, the Board is not bound by the findings of disability and/or unemployability made by other agencies, including SSA."
1813552P110S4,,CitationSentence,"See Collier v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 413, 417 (1991)."
1813552P110S5,,Sentence,Adjudication of VA and SSA claims is based on different laws and regulations.
1813552P110S6,,EvidenceSentence,"In this case, SSA determined that the Veteran was not disabled."
1813552P111S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, during his 2012 VA examination, the Veteran stated that his age and lack of experience, not his service-connected disability, prevented him from securing a position."
1813552P111S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Board notes that although the Veteran experienced PTSD symptoms, the symptoms did not prevent him from functioning."
1813552P111S4,,FindingSentence,"Thus, the medical evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran's service-connected disability prevented him from being able to obtain and secure substantially gainful employment."
1813552P112S2,,FindingSentence,"While the Board does not doubt that the Veteran's disability has a significant effect on his employability, the weight of the evidence does not support his contention that his service-connected disability is of such severity so as to preclude his participation in any form of substantially gainful employment based on his occupational background and level of education."
1813552P112S3,,FindingSentence,"As such, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable, and the claim must be denied."
1813552P112S4,,CitationSentence,"See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990)."
1813552P113S2,Sentence,CitationSentence,"As the record of evidence does not indicate that the Veteran was rendered unemployable by reason of his service-connected disability, the Board is not required to submit the Veteran's claim to the Director of Compensation Service for extraschedular consideration under 38 C.F.R.

1813552P116S3,FindingSentence,EvidenceSentence,"As of April 25, 2013, the Veteran meets the threshold requirement for TDIU."
1813552P116S4,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(a).
1813552P117S2,,ReasoningSentence,The Board must now consider whether the evidence reflects that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities render him unemployable.
1813552P117S3,,EvidenceSentence,"In his June 2015 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran reported that he last worked in January 2009 and left his job as a result of his disabilities."

1813552P120S5,,EvidenceSentence,He did not get along with others and would rather stay to himself.
1813552P120S6,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner stated that whatever social skills the Veteran had prior to his military experiences were no longer functional.
1813552P120S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner stated that given the severity of the Veteran's PTSD, his ability to function in an occupational environment would be very limited."

1813760P17S4,,FindingSentence,"While the Veteran has asserted a claim of service connection for PTSD, the record indicates assessments of other acquired psychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety."
1813760P17S5,,Sentence,"Accordingly, the Board has recharacterized the issue on appeal."

1813760P18S3,,Sentence,A transcript of that proceeding has been associated with the record.
1813760P19S2,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board notes that additional evidence was submitted after the issuance of the February 2016 supplemental statement of the case (SSOC); however, the Veteran has waived local consideration of such additional evidence."

1813760P30S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125(a), i.e., a diagnosis conforming to specified diagnostic criteria (currently the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), previously the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link, or causal nexus, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor."

1813760P31S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"If a PTSD claim is based on in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the Veteran's service records may corroborate the Veteran's account of the stressor incident."

1813760P34S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran contends that her PTSD is due to military sexual trauma she experienced while on active duty.
1813760P34S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Specifically, the Veteran has reported that, in the summer of 1981, she was sexually assaulted by her unit swim coach, who was also her Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC)."
1813760P34S4,,CitationSentence,See June 2011 Stressor Statement.
1813760P34S5,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"After winning a swim tournament, her NCOIC offered her ride to a post-win celebration."
1813760P34S6,,EvidenceSentence,"While in the car, the NCOIC began to touch the Veteran despite her objections."
1813760P34S7,,EvidenceSentence,"She tried to fight him off, but he overpowered her."
1813760P34S8,,EvidenceSentence,"After forcing himself upon her and raping her, the NCOIC threatened the Veteran not to speak about the incident because no one would believe her, as he had served for years and people respected him."
1813760P34S9,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran reported that she felt helpless and hopeless and that her NCOIC made it sound as if it were her fault she had been raped.
1813760P34S10,,EvidenceSentence,"She explained that the fear he instilled in her caused her to not confide in anyone, nor seek medical attention."
1813760P34S11,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was manipulated into believing that she could not trust anyone.
1813760P34S12,,EvidenceSentence,She worked with her NCOIC and had to see him every day.
1813760P34S13,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran had been a virgin and was engaged to be married in July 1981.
1813760P34S14,,EvidenceSentence,"After the assault, she called off her wedding two weeks prior to the date."
1813760P35S2,,EvidenceSentence,"With regard to a present disability, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD, which was originally diagnosed in August 2010."
1813760P35S3,,EvidenceSentence,The diagnosis was confirmed according to DSM-IV criteria in a June 2011 VA examination.
1813760P35S4,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board notes that although this matter was certified after August 4, 2014 (requiring use of the DSM-5), the Board finds the DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD is adequate for adjudication purposes."
1813760P35S5,,FindingSentence,"Accordingly, the Board finds that the first element required for a finding of service connection has been met."
1813760P36S2,,ReasoningSentence,"With regard to an in-service stressor, the Board notes that there is no specific documentation of the Veteran's claimed sexual assault while on active duty."
1813760P36S3,,EvidenceSentence,"However, in a June 2011 statement, the Veteran reported that she had requested reassignment to the flag records section."
1813760P36S4,,EvidenceSentence,Military personnel records confirm this transfer through an October 1981 letter of recommendation from the Veteran's NCOIC for the Veteran's reassignment.
1813760P37S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In a June 2011 statement, the Veteran stated that she had repressed her memories of her in-service sexual assault until 2003 or 2004 when a visit to a mental health professional caused the memories to resurface."
1813760P38S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In a September 2014 statement, the Veteran's husband recounted that the Veteran was assigned to his squad in the summer of 1981."
1813760P38S3,,EvidenceSentence,"He recalled her as a happy, outgoing, friendly, and dedicated individual."

1813760P38S6,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's husband stated that it was not until several years later, after continued counseling, that he learned that the Veteran's change in behavior 1981 was due to a sexual assault by their NCOIC."
1813760P38S7,,EvidenceSentence,He stated that the Veteran knew how the system worked and that she would not receive any help from the chain of command.
1813760P38S8,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's husband noted that it was likely that the Veteran did not confide in him because she was aware that he disliked their NCOIC and feared how he might react.
1813760P39S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In an August 2016 statement, the Veteran's husband reported that he was her squad leader in the summer of 1981."
1813760P39S3,,EvidenceSentence,"He described her as someone who kept to herself, but was upbeat and attended all company social functions, which she seemed to enjoy."
1813760P39S4,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"In midsummer, the Veteran's husband noticed a sudden change in the Veteran's behavior."

1813760P39S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's husband noted that she seemed distracted, confused, and cautious about joining any activities."
1813760P40S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In a November 2017 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that she was a happy, friendly, and outgoing before she was sexually assaulted in the summer of 1981."
1813760P40S3,,EvidenceSentence,"After she was assaulted, she became withdrawn, stayed in the barracks, and stopped participating on the unit swim team."
1813760P40S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran testified that she was sexually assaulted by her chain of command and that her request to transfer departments following her assault was eventually granted.
1813760P40S5,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's husband testified that he was a platoon sergeant at the time and that the Veteran had been assigned to his squad.
1813760P40S6,,EvidenceSentence,He remembered her as friendly and easygoing and that she would attend company functions.
1813760P40S7,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's husband testified that he noticed when the Veteran's behavior changed all of a sudden.
1813760P40S8,,EvidenceSentence,She seemed depressed and wanted to be alone.
1813760P40S9,,EvidenceSentence,"After years of marriage, the Veteran finally told her husband what she had experienced in service."
1813760P40S10,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's husband recalled hearing complaints that their NCOIC would flirt with all the women.
1813760P41S2,,EvidenceSentence,Private and VA mental health treatment records consistently note the Veteran's recounts of her military sexual assault.
1813760P42S2,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board finds that the Veteran and her husband, who served as her squad leader in the summer of 1981, have provided competent and credible statements and testimony regarding the Veteran's military sexual assault."
1813760P42S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Further, the Veteran has provided consistent statements to healthcare providers regarding her sexual assault."
1813760P42S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, the Veteran's military personnel records confirm that she had been transferred to another division in the fall of 1981."
1813760P42S5,,FindingSentence,"As such, the Board finds that the second element required for a finding of service connection has been met."
1813760P43S2,,Sentence,The remaining question is whether there is a medical nexus between the Veteran's in-service experience and her current diagnosis of PTSD.
1813760P44S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In the Veteran's June 2011 VA examination for PTSD, the Veteran reported symptoms beginning in 2009."
1813760P44S3,,EvidenceSentence,She had suppressed many feelings and treatment from a metal health counselor prompted their resurfacing.
1813760P44S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran reported that she was depressed, anxious, irritable, startled by sudden noises, and intolerant of crowds."
1813760P44S5,,EvidenceSentence,She experienced memory problems and had difficultly expressing herself.
1813760P44S6,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's symptoms were constant, continuous, and ongoing."
1813760P44S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran noted that, prior to service, she was involved in social activities and church activities and had good relationships with others."
1813760P44S8,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran reported that she joined the swim team and after winning a swim tournament one day, she accepted a ride from her NCOIC."
1813760P44S9,,EvidenceSentence,"After arriving at their destination, her NCOIC proceeded to lock the car doors, overpower her, and rape her."
1813760P44S10,,EvidenceSentence,"Afterwards, he threatened that no one would believe her word over his, so she never reported or received treatment for the sexual assault."
1813760P44S11,,EvidenceSentence,The VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's response to the stressor was intense fear and helplessness because her NCOIC was so much bigger than her and because of his power in the Army.
1813760P44S12,,EvidenceSentence,She was stunned or shocked by the traumatic event and believed her life was threatened and that she could be physically injured in the situation.
1813760P44S13,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted that the Veteran felt a sense of horror at the loss of her virginity and self-worth.
1813760P44S14,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was found to be a reliable historian.
1813760P44S15,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD, major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, and primary insomnia."
1813760P44S16,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted that the diagnoses were related and represented a progression of the Veteran's primary diagnosis of PTSD.
1813760P44S17,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's PTSD caused the symptoms that lead to depression and her insomnia was the result of both.
1813760P45S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In a June 2013 addendum VA medical opinion, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD was at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service event."
1813760P45S3,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner had reviewed the Veteran's service and treatment records and noted that the Veteran clearly had severe mental health issues diagnosed as PTSD.
1813760P45S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner noted that while there was no evidence beyond self-report of the rape, the Veteran's statements and symptoms of the trauma appeared credible."
1813760P46S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In an October 2017 letter, Dr. A. Z., a staff psychologist with VA, indicated that she had been treating the Veteran for PTSD with an evidenced based trauma focused treatment called Prolonged Exposure."
1813760P46S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Throughout this form of psychotherapy, the Veteran had consistently recounted the details of her military sexual trauma, the description of the assault, identification of her superior officer, and the subsequent changes in functioning at work and within her relationships immediately following the traumatic event."
1813760P46S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Dr. A. Z. indicated that the Veteran had been diagnosed with depressive disorder, not otherwise specified, and anxiety, not otherwise specified, in 2004."
1813760P46S5,,EvidenceSentence,"She noted that this pattern of diagnoses were often seen in the early stages of treatment and, in her expert opinion, these diagnoses were consistent with the Veteran's diagnosis of PTSD and did not represent unrelated conditions."
1813760P46S6,,EvidenceSentence,Dr. A. Z. opined that the Veteran's quality of life had been significantly reduced by PTSD secondary to a military sexual trauma she endured during service.
1813760P47S2,,FindingSentence,The Board finds that the final element required for a finding of service connection has been met.
1813760P47S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The June 2011 VA examiner found the Veteran to be a reliable historian and based on her recounting of her in-service sexual assault, diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and secondary diagnoses of major depressive disorder and primary insomnia."
1813760P47S4,,EvidenceSentence,"After a review of the Veteran's records, the June 2013 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD was as least as likely as not caused by an in-service event."
1813760P47S5,,EvidenceSentence,"He, too, found the Veteran's self-report of her military sexual assault to be credible."
1813760P47S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Finally, Dr. A. Z. stated that the Veteran had consistently reported the details of her in-service sexual assault and Dr. A. Z. believed that the Veteran's PTSD was related to her in-service military sexual trauma."
1813760P47S7,,FindingSentence,"Accordingly, the Board resolves all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and finds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD due to military sexual trauma, is warranted."

1814035P22S2,,Sentence,2.
1814035P22S3,,FindingSentence,The evidence of record favors a finding that the Veteran's sleep disorder was caused by his service-connected PTSD.
1814035P23S2,,Sentence,3.
1814035P23S3,,EvidenceSentence,"For the entire timeframe on appeal, the Veteran's PTSD was manifested by symptoms such as anxiety, depressed mood, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, concentration difficulties, nightmares, intrusive thoughts, exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, avoidance behaviors, feelings of detachment, impaired impulse control, and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; all resulting in occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity."
1814035P24S2,,Sentence,4.
1814035P24S3,,FindingSentence,At no time during the appeal period did the Veteran's service-connected disabilities preclude him from obtaining and retaining substantially gainful employment.

1814035P34S2,,LegalRuleSentence,Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.
1814035P34S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§Â§  1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(a)."
1814035P34S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service."
1814035P34S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(d).
1814035P35S2,,LegalRuleSentence,Direct service connection may not be granted without evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury.
1814035P35S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 1112; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304.
1814035P35S4,,CitationSentence,"See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)."
1814035P36S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In addition to the regulations cited above, service connection is warranted for a disability which is aggravated by, proximately due to, or the result of a service-connected disease or injury."

1814035P38S2,,Sentence,A. Bilateral Hearing Loss
1814035P39S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran contends that he suffers from bilateral hearing loss as a result of his exposure to noise during service.
1814035P40S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Service connection for impaired hearing is subject to 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.385, which provides that impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent."
1814035P41S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran was afforded a VA audiological examination in July 2012, about 6 years after his separation from service."
1814035P41S3,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"Pure tone thresholds, measured in decibels, were as follows:"

1814035P80S2,ReasoningSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"However, even at the time of separation, the Veteran did not demonstrate a hearing loss to the degree of severity required to be considered a disability for VA purposes."
1814035P81S2,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Throughout the entire appeal period, the Veteran has not demonstrated that he has a current hearing loss disability as defined by VA."
1814035P81S3,FindingSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"In comparing the results of the VA examination to the regulatory criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.385, the Board must conclude that the preponderance of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran currently suffers from a bilateral hearing loss disability as defined for VA compensation purposes."
1814035P81S4,ReasoningSentence,CitationSentence,"Importantly, no other competent medical evidence in the record indicates a hearing loss disability in accordance with 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.385."
1814035P81S5,CitationSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"See also McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007) (explaining that the requirement of a current disability can be satisfied when the claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim, and that a claimant may be granted service connection even though the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim)."
1814035P81S6,,ReasoningSentence,"In this regard, the Veteran does not have an auditory threshold of 40 decibels or greater in any of the frequencies or 26 decibels or greater for at least three of the frequencies."
1814035P81S7,,EvidenceSentence,"Further, his speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are 94 percent or greater bilaterally."
1814035P81S8,,LegalRuleSentence,"In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection as Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service connection to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability."
1814035P81S9,,CitationSentence,"Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992)."
1814035P82S2,,ReasoningSentence,"In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the Veteran's arguments in support of his assertions that he suffers from bilateral hearing loss as a result of his service."
1814035P82S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"However, the resolution of an issue that involves medical knowledge, such as the diagnosis of a disorder, requires professional evidence."
1814035P82S4,,LegalRuleSentence,It is true that the Veteran's lay statements may be competent to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of the disorder or symptoms of the disorder subject to lay observation.
1814035P82S5,,CitationSentence,"See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (addressing lay evidence as potentially competent to support presence of disorder even where not corroborated by contemporaneous medical evidence)."
1814035P82S6,,ReasoningSentence,"However, bilateral hearing loss is determined by the results of audiological testing, and is therefore not solely disposed of lay opinions as to diagnosis and/or etiology."
1814035P83S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine."
1814035P83S3,,FindingSentence,"However, the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss, and the appeal is denied."
1814035P84S2,,Sentence,B. Sleep Disorder
1814035P85S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was diagnosed with insomnia in March 2010.
1814035P85S3,,CitationSentence,"See March 26, 2010, VA Treatment Record."
1814035P85S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, he was diagnosed with a sleep disorder at the time of the August 2012 VA psychological examination."
1814035P85S5,,CitationSentence,See August 2010 VA Psychological Examination Report.
1814035P86S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In July 2016, the Veteran underwent a VA psychological examination, at which time the examiner concluded that the Veteran's sleep difficulties were at least at likely as not due to his PTSD."
1814035P86S3,,EvidenceSentence,"He reasoned that sleep impairment is a common symptom of PTSD, and resulted from nightmares and intrusive thoughts as reported by the Veteran."
1814035P86S4,,ReasoningSentence,The Board finds this opinion to be highly probative.
1814035P86S5,,CitationSentence,"See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007)."
1814035P87S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Board notes that, at the time of the July 2016 examination, the examiner did not provide a separate diagnosis of a sleep disorder, as the DSM-5 criteria for insomnia stated that ""coexisting mental disorder and medical conditions do not adequately explain the predominant complaint of insomnia."""
1814035P87S3,,EvidenceSentence,"However, although the July 2016 examiner did not determine that the Veteran had a separate diagnosis of a sleep disorder, multiple VA treatment records and previous VA psychological examination reports diagnosed the Veteran with both insomnia and a sleep disorder."
1814035P87S4,,ReasoningSentence,"Thus, the Board is persuaded by the July 2016 examiner's opinion, which indicates that the Veteran's previously diagnosed sleep disorder is caused, or is at least aggravated, by his service-connected PTSD."
1814035P87S5,,FindingSentence,"Thus, the Board finds that the evidence both for and against the Veteran's service-connection claim is at the very least in equipoise, demonstrating that the Veteran has a current sleep disorder that is at least as likely as not caused or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD."
1814035P87S6,,Sentence,The benefit sought on appeal is granted.
1814035P88S2,,Sentence,III.
1814035P88S3,,Sentence,Increased Rating for PTSD
1814035P89S2,EvidenceSentence,FindingSentence,The Veteran is currently in receipt of service connection for PTSD evaluated as 50 percent disabling.
1814035P89S3,,FindingSentence,"For the reasons described below, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD does not warrant a rating in excess of 50 percent at any time during the period on appeal."
1814035P90S2,,Sentence,Law and Regulations
1814035P91S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).
1814035P91S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Part 4 (2017).
1814035P91S4,,LegalRuleSentence,The Rating Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disabilities resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.
1814035P91S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations."
1814035P91S6,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.1.
1814035P92S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Where the appeal arises from the original assignment of a disability evaluation following an award of service connection, the severity of the disability at issue is to be considered during the entire period from the initial assignment of the disability rating to the present time."
1814035P92S3,,CitationSentence,"See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999)."
1814035P92S4,,LegalRuleSentence,Staged ratings are appropriate for an increased rating claim whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.
1814035P92S5,,CitationSentence,"See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 50 (2007)."
1814035P93S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"VA should interpret reports of examination in light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability."
1814035P93S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.2.
1814035P93S4,,LegalRuleSentence,Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability shall be resolved in favor of the claimant.
1814035P93S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.3.
1814035P93S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations apply, the higher of the two should be assigned where the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating."
1814035P93S7,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.7.
1814035P94S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"The Board has reviewed all of the evidence in the Veteran's claims file, with an emphasis on the medical and lay evidence for the issue on appeal."
1814035P94S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, the extensive evidence of record."
1814035P94S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"Indeed, the Federal Circuit has held that the Board must review the entire record, but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence."
1814035P94S5,,CitationSentence,"Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000)."
1814035P94S6,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"Therefore, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim."
1814035P95S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Under Diagnostic Code 9411, a 50 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships."
1814035P95S3,,CitationSentence,Id.
1814035P96S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A 70 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships."
1814035P96S3,,CitationSentence,Id.
1814035P97S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A 100 percent rating is warranted when there is total occupational and social impairment due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name."
1814035P97S3,,CitationSentence,Id.
1814035P98S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In order to be assigned a particular rating, a Veteran need not demonstrate the presence of all, most, or even some, of the symptoms listed as examples in the rating criteria."
1814035P98S3,,CitationSentence,"See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002)."
1814035P98S4,,ReasoningSentence,The key element for a rating under the General Formula for Mental Disorders is the degree of social and occupational impairment caused by those symptoms.
1814035P99S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Further, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has acknowledged the ""symptom-driven nature"" of the General Rating Formula and that ""a veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating under Â§ 4.130 by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration."""
1814035P99S3,,CitationSentence,"Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 116 (Fed. Cir. 2013)."
1814035P99S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"The Federal Circuit has explained that ""symptomatology should be the fact-finder's primary focus when deciding entitlement to a given disability rating."""
1814035P99S5,,CitationSentence,Id. at 117.
1814035P100S2,,Sentence,Analysis
1814035P101S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In August 2012, the Veteran was afforded a VA psychological examination."

1814035P102S3,,EvidenceSentence,He continued to have positive relationships with his family and friends.

1814035P102S10,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner determined that he displayed occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decreased work efficiency and the ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress.
1814035P103S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In January 2013, post-service VA treatment records reflect that, on two occasions, the Veteran reported occasional thoughts of suicide and sometimes wished he was dead."
1814035P103S3,,EvidenceSentence,Treatment providers did not find these thoughts to be persistent.
1814035P103S4,,CitationSentence,"See January 8, 2013 and January 17, 2013 VA Treatment Records."
1814035P104S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In April 2013, the Veteran was afforded a third VA examination to evaluate his PTSD."
1814035P104S3,,EvidenceSentence,"He described maintaining contact with his father and friends from high school, as well as casual local friends."

1814035P105S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran was noted to be cooperative with a euthymic mood, as well as normal orientation, reasoning, and speech."
1814035P105S3,,EvidenceSentence,"He did not display objective evidence of hallucinations, delusions, obsessive or ritualistic behavior, panic attacks, or suicidal or homicidal intent."
1814035P105S4,,EvidenceSentence,"However, he did display mild memory and concentration impairment."
1814035P105S5,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was able to complete activities of daily living and maintain his personal hygiene.
1814035P105S6,,EvidenceSentence,He was capable of managing his own finances.
1814035P105S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner noted that he described alternating periods of mild depression and mild irritability, which had improved and were attributed to his mood disorder."
1814035P105S8,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner determined that he displayed occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to his psychological diagnoses as a whole.
1814035P105S9,,EvidenceSentence,"However, the examiner further noted that the PTSD diagnosis alone resulted in occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decreased work efficiency and the ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress."
1814035P106S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Most recently, in July 2016, the Veteran underwent another VA examination to evaluate the severity of his PTSD."
1814035P106S3,,EvidenceSentence,"He stated that he did not engage in many social activities, but would socialize with friends on the weekend."
1814035P106S4,,EvidenceSentence,He also enjoyed hobbies including training his dog and riding horses.
1814035P106S5,,EvidenceSentence,He was enrolled in college courses online and had been employed at a golf course for the past two years.
1814035P106S6,,EvidenceSentence,"He reported symptoms including hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, impaired impulse control in the form of irritable behavior and angry outbursts, reckless or self-destructive behavior, concentration and memory difficulties, depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, sleep impairment, occasional nightmares, isolated panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, feelings of detachment, a persistent negative emotional state and persistent inability to express positive emotions, markedly diminished interest in activities, and avoidance behaviors."
1814035P106S7,,EvidenceSentence,He also reported difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.
1814035P106S8,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner further noted intense or prolonged psychological distress, as well as marked physiological reactions due to exposure to cues symbolizing the traumatic event."
1814035P106S9,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran demonstrated persistent negative beliefs about himself, persistent distorted cognitions about the traumatic event, and an inability to remember important aspects of the traumatic event."
1814035P107S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran was described as well groomed, cooperative, and alert, with normal orientation, speech, and thought processes."
1814035P107S3,,EvidenceSentence,No psychotic processes or psychomotor agitation was observed.
1814035P107S4,,EvidenceSentence,"His affect and mood were appropriate, and he demonstrated intact judgment and insight."
1814035P107S5,,EvidenceSentence,He denied homicidal and suicidal ideation.
1814035P107S6,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was noted to be capable of managing his finances.
1814035P107S7,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner determined that he displayed occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.
1814035P108S2,,FindingSentence,"Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence does not support an increased rating in excess of 50 percent for PTSD."
1814035P109S2,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Although there was a slight increase in symptoms, the evidence shows the increase was related to his other psychological disorders, including his non service-connected mood disorder."
1814035P109S3,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, there is no lay or medical evidence demonstrating additional symptoms such as obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances; or an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships."
1814035P110S2,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board notes that the July 2016 examination identified isolated panic attacks, but there is no indication that such attacks occurred on a near-continuous basis."
1814035P110S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, the VA psychological examination reports of record have noted impaired impulse control and irritability."
1814035P110S4,,EvidenceSentence,"However, no specific incidents demonstrating instances of unprovoked irritability with periods of violence have been reported in either the VA treatment records or the VA examination reports."
1814035P110S5,,EvidenceSentence,"In fact, a December 7, 2012, VA treatment noted that the Veteran did not have a history of violence."
1814035P110S6,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,This indicates that these symptoms are not of the severity or degree that would warrant a 70 percent (or higher) disability rating.
1814035P110S7,,EvidenceSentence,"Furthermore, the Board acknowledges that post-service treatment records indicate two instances of reported suicidal thoughts for a brief period of time in January 2013."
1814035P110S8,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"However, the remainder of the record is silent regarding suicidal or homicidal ideation, and the Veteran consistently denied such thoughts in the months and years following January 2013."
1814035P110S9,,FindingSentence,"Thus, the Board finds that this isolated incident is not reflective of the Veteran's disability picture as a whole throughout the entire appeal period."
1814035P111S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, the evidence does not show the Veteran has occupational and social impairment in all or even most areas, as he has reported maintaining positive relationships with his family members and regularly interacting with friends."
1814035P111S3,,EvidenceSentence,He also reported that he occasionally attended church and enjoyed several hobbies.
1814035P111S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Regarding any occupational impairment, the Veteran has consistently demonstrated employment throughout the appeal period, including as a firefighter, mechanic, and groundskeeper for a golf course."
1814035P111S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The Board notes that he experienced a lapse in employment after an arrest in late 2012; however, the record clearly demonstrates that he has maintained steady employment since that time."
1814035P111S6,EvidenceSentence,FindingSentence,"Additionally, the Veteran has consistently been enrolled in college courses throughout the appeal period."
1814035P111S7,,EvidenceSentence,"Again, although he was unable to complete the semester after his 2012 arrest, he has since reported continuing his studies."
1814035P111S8,,FindingSentence,"Thus, the evidence of record does not demonstrate occupational and social impairment in all or most areas."
1814035P112S2,,ReasoningSentence,"Additionally, at no point throughout the period on appeal, have the Veteran's symptoms of PTSD manifested to such a degree that more nearly approximates the criteria for a 100 percent disability rating."
1814035P112S3,,EvidenceSentence,"For example, there is no evidence showing that the Veteran's PTSD was manifested by such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name."
1814035P112S4,,EvidenceSentence,"VA examinations consistently noted good judgment and insight; normal speech, logical thought processes; and cooperative behavior."
1814035P112S5,,ReasoningSentence,"Despite the Veteran's mild memory loss, there is no indication that such caused him to forget the names of his close relatives, his own occupation, or his own name."
1814035P112S6,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, a 100 percent disability rating is not warranted at any point during the appeal period."
1814035P113S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Board acknowledges that the Veteran, in advancing this appeal, believes that his PTSD is more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects."
1814035P113S3,,ReasoningSentence,"In this regard, he is competent to report observable symptoms."
1814035P113S4,,CitationSentence,"Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994)."
1814035P113S5,,ReasoningSentence,"In this case, however, the competent medical evidence offering detailed specific specialized determinations pertinent to the rating criteria is the most probative evidence with regard to evaluating the pertinent symptoms for the disability on appeal; the medical evidence also largely contemplates the Veteran's description of symptoms."
1814035P113S6,ReasoningSentence,LegalRuleSentence,The lay evidence has been considered together with the probative medical evidence clinically evaluating the severity of the pertinent disability symptoms.
1814035P114S2,ReasoningSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"In evaluating the Veteran's increased rating claim, the Board is aware that the symptoms listed under the 50 and 70 percent ratings are essentially examples of the type and degree of symptoms for that rating, and that the Veteran need not demonstrate those exact symptoms to warrant a higher rating."
1814035P114S3,,CitationSentence,"See Mauerhan, supra."
1814035P114S4,,FindingSentence,"However, the Board finds that the record does not show the Veteran manifested symptoms that equal or more nearly approximate the criteria for a 70 percent (or higher) rating at any point during the appeal period."
1814035P115S1,FindingSentence,Sentence,"In summary, although the Veteran has other symptoms i.e. suicidal ideation and impaired impulse control, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD more nearly approximated the level of disability contemplated by the 50 percent rating."
1814035P115S2,FindingSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"The Board finds that the Veteran's deficiencies must be due to symptoms listed for that rating level, or others of similar severity, frequency and duration."
1814035P115S3,CitationSentence,Sentence,"Vasquez-Claudio, supra."
1814035P115S4,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Here, the symptoms noted during the VA examinations during the appeal period are of similar severity, frequency, and duration of those noted under the criteria for a 50 percent rating."
1814035P115S5,,FindingSentence,"Thus, a rating in excess of 50 percent for the service-connected PTSD is denied."
1814035P116S2,,Sentence,IV.
1814035P116S3,,Sentence,Entitlement to TDIU
1814035P117S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"A total disability rating for compensation purposes may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total and where it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more."
1814035P117S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(a).
1814035P117S4,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"Consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his or her age or to the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities."
1814035P117S5,,CitationSentence,"See 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.16, 4.19; see also Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993)."
1814035P118S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"To meet the requirement of ""one 60 percent disability"" or ""one 40 percent disability,"" the following will be considered as one disability: (1) disability of one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from one common etiology; (3) disabilities affecting a single body system; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; and (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war."
1814035P118S3,,CitationSentence,Id.
1814035P118S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,Substantially gainful employment is defined as work which is more than marginal and which permits the individual to earn a living wage.
1814035P118S5,,CitationSentence,"Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991)."
1814035P118S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"Marginal employment may also be held to exist, on a facts-found basis (including, but not limited to, employment in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop), when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold."
1814035P118S7,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16.
1814035P119S2,ReasoningSentence,FindingSentence,"Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities include: PTSD, with alcohol abuse disorder, rated at 50 percent disabling; left and right knee disabilities each rated at 10 percent disabling; mild chronic lumbar strain rated at 10 percent disabling; and tinnitus rated at 10 percent disabling, resulting in a combined rating of 70 percent, with one disability rated at 40 percent or more."
1814035P119S3,FindingSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Therefore, the Veteran meets the schedular requirements for TDIU."
1814035P120S2,ReasoningSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"With the threshold requirements satisfied, the Board must examine whether the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service-connected disabilities."
1814035P121S2,,FindingSentence,"In this case, the Board finds that consideration of a total rating based on unemployability is not warranted."
1814035P121S3,,FindingSentence,"As discussed more fully below, the most probative and credible evidence shows that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have not rendered him unable to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment."
1814035P122S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In his February 2017 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, he mentioned PTSD as the main service-connected disability preventing him from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation."
1814035P122S3,,EvidenceSentence,"However, he reported that he was currently employed on a full-time basis, and earned $30,000 in 2016 while employed as a groundskeeper for a golf course."
1814035P123S2,,EvidenceSentence,VA psychological examination reports indicate that the Veteran has generally maintained consistent employment since his separation from service.
1814035P123S3,,EvidenceSentence,"As noted above, he reported employment as a firefighter, a mechanic, and a groundskeeper for a golf course between August 2012 and July 2016."
1814035P123S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Board acknowledges that the Veteran experienced a temporary lapse in employment after his arrest in 2012.
1814035P123S5,,EvidenceSentence,"However, the record indicates that he has obtained full-time employment since that time."
1814035P123S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, the opinions provided in these reports found that the Veteran did not demonstrate total occupational impairment, or occupational impairment with deficiencies in the area of work."
1814035P123S7,,EvidenceSentence,"Furthermore, he did not report a complete inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, such as in the workplace."
1814035P124S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Board notes that an August 2012 VA examination report contained the examiner's opinion that the Veteran's back and knee disabilities could potentially limit his ability to stand for prolonged periods of time, lift heavy objects, and squat."
1814035P124S3,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner further noted that the Veteran was currently employed as a firefighter at that time.
1814035P124S4,,EvidenceSentence,"However, he did not report experiencing limitations or periods of absence as a result of his disabilities, despite the strenuous nature of the position."
1814035P125S2,,FindingSentence,"In this case, the weight of the evidence is simply against the conclusion that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have rendered him incapable of working with consideration of his employment history and the medical evidence of record."
1814035P125S3,,ReasoningSentence,"Indeed, he has maintained consistent employment and is currently employed on a full-time basis as a groundskeeper at a golf course."
1814035P125S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, the medical opinion evidence of record does not indicate that any of his disabilities impact his ability to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment."
1814035P125S5,,FindingSentence,"The Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for TDIU; therefore, entitlement to TDIU must be denied."
1814035P125S6,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§ 5107; 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.3, 4.7."
1814035P126S2,,ReasoningSentence,"Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record."
1814035P126S3,CitationSentence,ReasoningSentence,"See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record)."
1814035P127S1,,Sentence,ORDER
1814035P128S2,,Sentence,Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.
1814035P129S2,FindingSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"Entitlement to service connection for a sleep disorder, to include as secondary to service-connected PTSD, is granted."
1814035P130S2,,Sentence,Entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 50 percent for PTSD is denied.

1814540P17S1,,Sentence,INTRODUCTION
1814540P18S2,,ReasoningSentence,"The Veteran, who is the Appellant, served on active duty from October 1969 to October 1971."
1814540P19S2,,Sentence,"This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2012 rating decision from the Appeals Management Center, which, in pertinent part, granted service connection for common migraine secondary to PTSD, assigning a 30 percent initial disability rating (effective August 29, 2012)."
1814540P19S3,,EvidenceSentence,"This matter also comes on appeal from a December 2012 rating decision that granted a 50 percent disability rating for PTSD (effective October 30, 2012), and a July 2016 rating decision that denied a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for left knee instability, granted a temporary 100 percent disability rating for left knee osteoarthritis (effective May 5, 2016, the date of surgery), and reassigned a 10 percent disability rating for left knee osteoarthritis (effective July 1, 2016)."
1814540P19S4,,Sentence,"Because the RO assigned a temporary 100 percent rating for left knee osteoarthritis from May 5, 2016, the relevant increase rating period for left knee osteoarthritis is from July 1, 2016, the date a 10 percent disability rating was reassigned."
1814540P19S5,,Sentence,"The RO in Indianapolis, Indiana assigned a ""staged"" rating of 10 percent for left knee instability, effective August 30, 2017."
1814540P19S6,,CitationSentence,See September 2017 rating decision.
1814540P19S7,,Sentence,"Jurisdiction is currently with the RO in Indianapolis, Indiana."
1814540P20S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In an April 2014 rating decision, the RO found clear and unmistakable error in the effective date assigned for service connection for PTSD and migraine headaches secondary to PTSD, as well as the effective date assigned for an increased disability rating of 50 percent for PTSD."
1814540P20S3,,Sentence,"The RO corrected the effective date assigned for service connection for PTSD and migraine secondary to PTSD to June 2, 2005 (the date a claim for service connection for PTSD was received), and corrected the effective date assigned for an increased rating for PTSD to October 25, 2012 (the date an informal claim for increased rating for PTSD was received)."
1814540P20S4,,CitationSentence,"See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.400(b)(2)(i), (o) (2017)."
1814540P21S2,,Sentence,"Because the RO did not assign the maximum disability rating possible, the appeals for a higher disability rating remain before the Board."
1814540P21S3,,CitationSentence,See A.B.
1814540P21S4,,CitationSentence,"v@! Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993) (noting that where a claimant filed a notice of disagreement as to a RO decision assigning a particular rating, a subsequent RO decision assigning a higher rating but less than the maximum available benefits does not abrogate the pending appeal)."
1814540P22S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In October 2017, the Veteran testified at a travel Board hearing from the RO in Indianapolis, Indiana, before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge."
1814540P22S3,,Sentence,The hearing transcript has been associated with the record.

1814540P25S3,,EvidenceSentence,"For the rating period from October 25, 2012, the severity, frequency, and duration of the symptoms of the service-connected PTSD have not more nearly approximated occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas."
1814540P26S2,,Sentence,3.
1814540P26S3,,EvidenceSentence,"For the rating period from May 5, 2016 to August 30, 2017, the symptomatology and impairment of the left knee instability has not more nearly approximated severe instability or subluxation."
1814540P27S2,,Sentence,4.
1814540P27S3,,EvidenceSentence,"For the rating period from August 30, 2017, the symptomatology and impairment of the left knee instability has not more nearly approximated moderate instability or subluxation."

1814540P35S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
1814540P36S2,,Sentence,Duties to Notify and Assist
1814540P37S2,,Sentence,The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) and implementing regulations impose obligations on VA to provide claimants with notice and assistance.
1814540P37S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (2012); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.326(a) (2017)."
1814540P37S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"Upon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, VA is required to notify the claimant and his or her representative, if any, of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, that is necessary to substantiate the claim and of the relative duties of VA and the claimant for procuring that evidence."
1814540P37S5,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.159(b).
1814540P37S6,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,Such notice should also address VA's practices in assigning disability evaluations and effective dates for those evaluations.
1814540P37S7,,CitationSentence,"See Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson,"
1814540P38S2,,CitationSentence,19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).
1814540P38S3,,LegalRuleSentence,Notice should be provided to a claimant before the initial unfavorable AOJ decision on a claim.
1814540P38S4,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.159(b)(1); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 120 (2004); see also Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103, 110 (2005), rev'd on other grounds, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006)."
1814540P39S2,,FindingSentence,"As the appeal for a higher initial disability rating for migraine headaches arises from the Veteran's disagreement with the initial rating following the grant of service connection, no additional notice is required."
1814540P39S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) and the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court) have held that, once service connection is granted, the claim is substantiated, additional notice is not required, and any defect in notice is not prejudicial."
1814540P39S4,,CitationSentence,"Hartman v. Nicholson, 483 F.3d 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Dunlap v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 112 (2007); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.159(b)(3)(i) (no duty to provide VCAA notice upon receipt of a notice of disagreement); VAOPGCPREC 8-2003 (in which the VA General Counsel interpreted that separate notification is not required for ""downstream"" issues following a service connection grant, such as initial ratings and effective dates)."
1814540P40S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In a claim for increase, the VCAA requirement is generic notice, that is, the type of evidence needed to substantiate the claim, namely, evidence demonstrating a worsening or increase in severity of the disability and the effect that worsening has on employment, as well as general notice regarding how disability ratings and effective dates are assigned."
1814540P40S3,,CitationSentence,"Vazquez-Flores v. Shinseki, 580 F.3d 1270"
1814540P41S2,,CitationSentence,(Fed. Cir. 2009).
1814540P42S2,,EvidenceSentence,"As to the issues of increased disability rating for PTSD, left knee instability, and left knee osteoarthritis, VA issued the Veteran VCAA notice in November 2012 and May 2016, which informed of the evidence generally needed to support a claim for an increased disability rating, what actions needed to be undertaken, and how VA would assist in developing the claim."
1814540P42S3,,EvidenceSentence,The November 2012 and May 2016 VCAA notice letters were issued to the Veteran prior to the December 2012 and July 2016 rating decisions granting an increased rating for PTSD and denying an increased rating for left knee instability and osteoarthritis.
1814540P42S4,,EvidenceSentence,The increased rating issues were readjudicated in the April 2014 and July 2017 statements of the case (SOC) and the August 2017 and September 2017 supplemental statements of the case (SSOC).
1814540P42S5,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"For these reasons, there was no defect with respect to timing of the VCAA notice."
1814540P42S6,,CitationSentence,"See Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004)."
1814540P43S2,FindingSentence,EvidenceSentence,"With regard to the duty to assist, VA has satisfied its duties to assist the Veteran with regard to the issues on appeal."
1814540P43S3,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,VA has made reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records of evidence.
1814540P43S4,,ReasoningSentence,"Specifically, VA has associated with the claims file service treatment records, VA treatment records, private treatment records, the VA examination reports, the October 2017 Board hearing transcript, and the Veteran's lay statements."
1814540P44S2,FindingSentence,LegalRuleSentence,VA satisfied its duty to obtain a medical examination and opinion when required.
1814540P44S3,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C. Â§ 5103A; 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.159(c)(4), 3.326(a); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83 (2006)."
1814540P44S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran was provided with VA examinations (the reports of which have been associated with the claims file) in February 2006, March 2010, December 2012, September 2013, May 2016, and August 2017."
1814540P44S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"To that end, when VA undertakes to either provide an examination or to obtain an opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate."
1814540P44S6,,CitationSentence,"Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007)."
1814540P44S7,,ReasoningSentence,The Board finds that the VA examination reports taken together with the other evidence of record are thorough and adequate and provide a sound basis upon which to base decisions with regard to the issues on appeal.
1814540P44S8,,EvidenceSentence,"The VA examiners personally interviewed and examined the Veteran, including eliciting a history and reporting on past and present symptomatology and functional impairment, and provided opinions with supporting rationale."
1814540P45S2,,EvidenceSentence,"At the October 2017 Board hearing, the Veteran contended that the August 2017 psychological VA examination did not capture the whole disability picture of PTSD."
1814540P45S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran reported that panic attacks occur once a week, although anxiety is present daily, and sleep disturbance occurs nightly."
1814540P45S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran also testified that an honest account of the symptoms and functional impairment attributed to PTSD was provided during the August 2017 VA examination.
1814540P45S5,,CitationSentence,See October Board hearing transcript.
1814540P45S6,,EvidenceSentence,"The August 2017 VA examination report reflects that the Veteran was cooperative, exhibited appropriate behavior, was mildly anxious with persistent generalized anxiety, and had chronic sleep impairment."
1814540P45S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran reported infrequent panic attacks that occurred one or two times a year, which is a decreased in severity from prior VA examinations, but was an honest account of the manifestations of PTSD at that time per the October 2017 Board hearing testimony, and is consistent with the August 2017 VA examination report, which reflected panic attacks that occurred weekly or less often."
1814540P45S8,,EvidenceSentence,"Given the Veteran's October 2017 Board testimony that panic attacks occur once a week, the Veteran's statements do not indicate that signs and symptoms of PTSD are presently worse than the signs and symptoms present during the August 2017 VA examination or prior PTSD, i.e., panic attacks occurring weekly or less often."
1814540P45S9,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran also did not state that the current signs and symptoms of PTSD are more severe than were present during VA examinations in December 2012 and March 2013; therefore, there is no prejudice to the Veteran and the PTSD VA examinations are adequate for rating purposes."
1814540P46S2,,FindingSentence,"Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that all relevant facts have been properly and sufficiently developed in the appeals, and no further development is required to comply with the duty to assist in developing the facts pertinent to the appeals."
1814540P46S3,,Sentence,"In view of the foregoing, the Board will proceed with appellate review."
1814540P47S2,,Sentence,Disability Rating Criteria
1814540P48S2,LegalRuleSentence,CitationSentence,Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.
1814540P48S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 1155.
1814540P48S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances."
1814540P48S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.21.
1814540P49S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Where there is a question as to which of two disability ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating."
1814540P49S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned."
1814540P49S4,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.7.
1814540P49S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"It is the defined and consistently applied policy of VA to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent, however, with the facts shown in every case."
1814540P49S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant."
1814540P49S7,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.3.
1814540P50S2,Sentence,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran has appealed from the initial rating assigned for migraine.
1814540P50S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"In an appeal for a higher initial rating after a grant of service connection, all evidence submitted in support of a veteran's claim is to be considered."
1814540P50S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"Separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found, a practice known as ""staged"" ratings."
1814540P50S5,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.2; Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999)."
1814540P51S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Where an increase in an existing disability rating based on established entitlement to compensation is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern."
1814540P51S3,,CitationSentence,"Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994)."
1814540P51S4,,LegalRuleSentence,The relevant temporal focus for adjudicating an increased rating claim is on the evidence concerning the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim.
1814540P51S5,,CitationSentence,"Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007)."
1814540P52S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with"
1814540P53S2,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.25.
1814540P53S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Pyramiding, the rating of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when rating a veteran's service-connected disabilities."
1814540P53S4,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14.
1814540P53S5,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"It is possible for a veteran to have separate and distinct manifestations from the same injury which would permit rating under several diagnostic codes; however, the critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the conditions is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition."
1814540P53S6,,Sentence,"Esteban v. Brown,"
1814540P54S2,,CitationSentence,"6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994)."
1814540P55S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"When an unlisted condition is encountered, it will be permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous."
1814540P55S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Conjectural analogies will be avoided, as will the use of analogous ratings for conditions of doubtful diagnosis, or for those not fully supported by clinical and laboratory findings."
1814540P55S4,,LegalRuleSentence,Nor will ratings assigned to organic diseases and injuries be assigned by analogy to conditions of functional origin.
1814540P55S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.20.
1814540P56S2,,Sentence,"Initial Disability Rating for Migraines from June 2, 2005"
1814540P57S2,,EvidenceSentence,"For the initial rating period from June 2, 2005, the Veteran generally contends that the service-connected migraine headaches, rated 30 percent, warrant a higher initial rating under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100."
1814540P57S3,,EvidenceSentence,"On the November 2012 notice of disagreement, the Veteran wrote that headaches last anywhere from two to four hours, they affect concentration, and they sometimes leave the Veteran disoriented."
1814540P57S4,,EvidenceSentence,"At the October 2017 Board hearing, the Veteran reported an average of three headaches a week with associated symptoms of eye pressure, light sensitivity, and floaters."
1814540P58S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Migraine headaches are rated under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100, which provides a 10 percent rating with evidence of prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months."
1814540P58S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,A 30 percent rating is warranted for migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months.
1814540P58S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,A 50 percent rating is warranted for migraine headaches with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.
1814540P58S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"Although prostrating attacks are not defined in the rating criteria, medical guidance used by the VA Compensation Service indicates that such an attack causes one a lack of strength to the point of exhaustion."
1814540P58S6,,CitationSentence,See VA Compensation Service's Medical Electronic Performance Support System.
1814540P59S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"The Board has considered whether higher or separate ratings are warranted under the other Diagnostic Codes used to rate headaches, but finds that none apply."
1814540P59S3,FindingSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Therefore, higher or separate ratings under other Diagnostic Codes are not warranted."
1814540P59S4,,CitationSentence,"See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.124a, Diagnostic Codes 8103-8108."
1814540P60S2,,FindingSentence,"After a full review of the evidence, both lay and medical, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted for the service-connected migraine headaches for the rating period on appeal (from June 2, 2005)."
1814540P60S3,,EvidenceSentence,"During the rating period, the migraine headaches have primarily been manifested as headaches occurring two to three times a week with associated light sensitivity, pain, photophobia, and floaters; an average of one prostrating attack per month; and occasional absenteeism from work."
1814540P61S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran stated that a sinus surgery was performed prior to the initial rating period (from June 2, 2005) to relieve headaches, but the headaches continued."
1814540P61S3,,CitationSentence,See February 2008 DRO hearing transcript.
1814540P61S4,,EvidenceSentence,Private treatment records reflect that the Veteran underwent nasal septum reconstruction for deviated septum in January 2002.
1814540P61S5,,EvidenceSentence,A February 2002 private treatment record reflects that the Veteran reported that headaches occurred two to three times a week.
1814540P62S2,,EvidenceSentence,"A review of VA treatment records and the Veteran's own lay statements dated through the course of this appeal reflect that the Veteran has managed headaches with prescription medication but has not received any specialized treatment for headaches during the relevant period on appeal, from June 2, 2005."
1814540P62S3,,EvidenceSentence,"A June 2012 VA treatment record reflects that the Veteran reported a history of occasional headaches without lightheadedness or dizziness, but no treatment was provided at the time."
1814540P62S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran has stated that he has not been referred to a neurologist for migraines and has only managed the migraines with prescription Ibuprofen over the years.
1814540P62S5,,CitationSentence,See October 2017 Board hearing transcript.
1814540P62S6,,EvidenceSentence,"VA treatment records reflect a standing prescription for Ibuprofen, which has been prescribed for pain or inflammation in general, without specific treatment noted for migraines."

1814540P63S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran stated that Ibuprofen helped the headaches that last one hour and sometimes benefits the headaches that last all day, but is of no benefit to the most severe headache that can last up to 3 days."
1814540P63S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran stated that he learned to work through the headaches, including the headache that last up to three days, and continued his daily activities and work despite the pain."
1814540P63S5,,EvidenceSentence,"During the February 2006 PTSD VA examination, the Veteran also stated that he had an outstanding attendance record at work."
1814540P64S2,,EvidenceSentence,"During the March 2013 VA neurological examination, the Veteran reported a history of headaches that occurred about twice a week that could be accompanied by photophobia and eye pressure, but denied nausea or vomiting."
1814540P64S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran stated that headaches lasted for hours but less than half of them were prostrating.
1814540P64S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The headaches were managed with Ibuprofen with fair response, and the Veteran stated that he was able to work through the headaches most of the time."
1814540P64S5,,EvidenceSentence,A CT of the head conducted during the VA examination revealed an unremarkable brain.
1814540P65S2,,EvidenceSentence,"At the October 2017 Board hearing, the Veteran asserted that headaches usually start around 5:00 or 6:00 p.m."

1814540P66S2,,EvidenceSentence,"While the Veteran has some prostrating headaches with associated pain, photophobia, light sensitivity, and floaters, the medical and lay evidence of record indicates that the headaches have been managed with Ibuprofen throughout the course of this appeal, and the Veteran has generally been able to work and perform daily activities despite headaches, and would only be absent from work approximately 18 days during a 12-month period due to headaches."
1814540P66S3,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,The migraine headaches do not meet or more nearly approximate very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability to warrant a higher initial rating (50 percent) under Diagnostic Code 8100 at any time during the appeal period.

1814540P86S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Although the Veteran reported some anger and irritability, he denied any episodes of violence or lack of self-control, and the Veteran stated that he was involved in various social activities and maintained good relationships with family and friends."
1814540P87S1,,EvidenceSentence,"Although the Veteran now claims that sleep impairment is due, in part, to checking the windows approximately every two hours throughout the night, the Veteran testified that he is still able to function throughout the day despite getting only four to four and a half hours of sleep at night."
1814540P87S2,,CitationSentence,See October 2017 Board Hearing transcript.
1814540P87S3,,EvidenceSentence,Symptoms of checking the windows throughout the night are like or similar to hypervigilance at night.

1814540P89S3,,EvidenceSentence,The September 2013 VA examiner assessed occupational and social impairment due to mild and transient symptoms.
1814540P89S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The VA examiners as a whole, assessed occupation and social impairment that is less severe than is contemplated by the current 50 percent disability rating (occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability)."

1814540P90S4,,FindingSentence,"For these reasons, the Board finds that, for the entire rating period, the Veteran's disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for a 50 percent rating, based on symptoms and the degrees of social and occupational impairment; therefore, a disability rating in excess of 50 percent for the service-connected PTSD is not warranted for any part of the rating period."

1814540P130S3,EvidenceSentence,FindingSentence,"The left knee disability has manifested as osteoarthritis in the left knee with painful limitation of flexion to 45 degrees, to include during flare ups."
1814540P130S4,,LegalRuleSentence,Diagnostic Code 5010-5260 explicitly provides a 10 percent disability rating for x-ray findings of arthritis with limitation of flexion to 45 degrees.
1814540P130S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran has not endorsed and the evidence does not otherwise show additional limitation of motion due to pain, stiffness, and flare ups to meet the criteria for an increased disability rating based on limitation of motion, i.e., flexion limited to 30 degrees."
1814540P130S6,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5010-5260 5261."
1814540P130S7,,CitationSentence,"See Deluca, at 204-07; see also 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59."
1814540P131S1,,Sentence,The Board has considered whether a separate or alternative but higher disability rating is warranted for any other left knee disability.
1814540P131S2,,FindingSentence,"As the evidence of record does not reflect that the left knee is ankylosed, that there is malunion or nonunion of the tibia and fibula, that there is a current diagnosis of genu recurvatum, and/or that the service-connected left knee disability has been manifested by limitation of extension to a compensable degree (i.e. 10 degrees), a separate or higher disability rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Codes 5256, 5261, 5262, or 5263."
1814540P131S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.71a.
1814540P132S2,,FindingSentence,"Upon review of the lay and medical evidence of record, the Board finds that a rating under Diagnostic Code 5258 is not warranted for any part of the appeal period."
1814540P132S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Diagnostic Code 5258 requires dislocation of the semilunar cartilage with frequent episodes of ""locking,"" pain, and effusion into the joint."
1814540P132S4,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.71a.
1814540P132S5,ReasoningSentence,FindingSentence,"While the left knee disability has been manifested by meniscal tear, that is, dislocation of the meniscus (semilunar cartilage) and painful motion, the evidence of record does not reflect that the left knee disability has been manifested by frequent episodes of  joint ""locking"" and swelling (effusion) into the joint."
1814540P132S6,EvidenceSentence,ReasoningSentence,"Although the October 2015 MRI of the left knee showed a small effusion, the Veteran reported, for the purposes of seeking treatment, that swelling only occurred in the left knee ""from time-to-time,"" which weighs against a finding of frequent episodes of joint effusion or swelling."
1814540P132S7,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, prior to the May 2015 meniscectomy the Veteran only reported ""occasional"" locking in the knee, which is also less than frequent."
1814540P132S8,,CitationSentence,See February 2017 and May 2017 private treatment records.
1814540P132S9,,EvidenceSentence,"At the October 2017 Board hearing, the Veteran stated that there was pain, some swelling, ""clicking"" and ""popping"" in the knee but specifically denied any ""locking"" in the knee."
1814540P132S10,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, the VA examiners in May 2016 and August 2017 only assessed a history of meniscal tear with frequent episodes of locking and pain, but frequent episodes of effusion were not indicated."
1814540P132S11,,CitationSentence,See May 2016 and August 2017.
1814540P132S12,,FindingSentence,"As the weight of the evidence reflects that the semilunar dislocation has not resulted in frequent episodes of pain, locking and effusion, a separate rating under Diagnostic Code 5258 is not warranted for any part of the appeal period."
1814540P132S13,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.71a.
1814540P133S2,EvidenceSentence,FindingSentence,"The record does reflect that there has been removal of meniscal tissue (i.e., semilunar cartilage) during the relevant rating period."
1814540P133S3,,CitationSentence,See May 2016 VA treatment record and May 2016 VA examination report.
1814540P133S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,The critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various Diagnostic Codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the disabilities is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other disability.
1814540P133S5,,CitationSentence,"See Esteban, 6 Vet. App. at 261-62."
1814540P133S6,,EvidenceSentence,"In VAOPGCPREC 9-98, VA General Counsel considered a hypothetical situation in which a knee disability was rated under Diagnostic Code 5259 that was productive of pain, tenderness, friction, and osteoarthritis established by x-rays."
1814540P133S7,,EvidenceSentence,"For the purposes of the hypothetical, it was assumed that the knee disability rated under Diagnostic Code 5259 did not involve limitation of motion."
1814540P133S8,,LegalRuleSentence,"Given the findings of osteoarthritis, the General Counsel interpreted that, where a Diagnostic Code 5259 disability did not involve limitation of motion, a separate rating under Diagnostic Code 5003 in light of 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.40, 4.45, and 4.59 may be warranted."
1814540P133S9,,CitationSentence,"See Lichtenfels v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 484, 488 (1991)."
1814540P134S2,,LegalRuleSentence,The VA General Counsel opinion did not interpret that ratings could be assigned for both Diagnostic Code 5259 and the diagnostic codes pertaining to limitation of motion in all cases.
1814540P134S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"VA General Counsel further interpreted in VAOPGCPREC 9-98 that the removal of the semilunar cartilage may involve restriction of movement caused by tears and displacements of the menisci, and that the procedure may result in complications such as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, which can produce loss of motion; therefore, if the knee disability rated under Diagnostic Code 5259 does involve limitation of motion, then to assign a separate rating under the pertinent limitation of motion diagnostic code would violate the rules against pyramiding because the symptomatology contemplated by the different rating criteria would overlap with respect to limitation of motion."
1814540P134S4,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14; Esteban, 6 Vet. App. at 261 (the critical element is that none of the symptomatology for any condition is duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition)."
1814540P135S2,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board finds that the separate ratings under both Diagnostic Code 5259 (symptomatic removal of the semilunar cartilage) and 5260 (limitation of flexion) are not warranted in the present case, as to do so would constitute pyramiding."
1814540P135S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14.
1814540P135S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Under Diagnostic Code 5259, a maximum 10 percent rating is assigned for removal of semilunar cartilage which is symptomatic."
1814540P135S5,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5259."
1814540P135S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"That is, there are only two requirements for a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5259."
1814540P135S7,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"First, the semilunar cartilage or meniscus must have been removed."
1814540P135S8,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Second, it must be symptomatic."
1814540P135S9,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"Looking to the plain meaning of the terms used in the rating criteria, ""symptomatic"" means indicative, relating to or constituting the aggregate of symptoms of disease."
1814540P135S10,CitationSentence,Sentence,"STEDMAN'S MEDICAL DICTIONARY, 1743 (27th ed., 2000)."
1814540P135S11,,EvidenceSentence,"A symptom is any morbid phenomenon or departure from the normal in a structure, function, or sensation, experienced by a patient and indicative of disease."
1814540P135S12,,CitationSentence,Id. at 1742.
1814540P135S13,,ReasoningSentence,"Thus, the second Diagnostic Code 5259 requirement of being ""symptomatic"" is broad enough to encompass symptoms including pain, limitation of motion, stiffness, and instability."
1814540P136S2,ReasoningSentence,FindingSentence,"Here, the Veteran's left knee osteoarthritis has been manifested by limitation of flexion to 45 degrees during flare ups, which is contemplated by the rating criteria under both Diagnostic Code 5259, as a symptomatic residual of the semilunar cartilage removal, and Diagnostic Code 5260, as limitation of flexion."
1814540P136S3,,ReasoningSentence,"As the limitation of flexion manifested by the left knee osteoarthritis is contemplated by the criteria for both Diagnostic Codes, the Board finds that assigning separate ratings under Diagnostic Code 5259 and Diagnostic Code 5260 would constitute pyramiding as it would compensate the Veteran twice for the same symptomatology (here, limitation of flexion)."
1814540P136S4,,CitationSentence,"See Lyles v. Shulkin, No. 16-994 (November 29, 2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14 prohibits compensating a veteran twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment); see also Esteban, at 261-62; 38 C.F.R. 4.14."
1814540P136S5,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"Moreover, the Veteran is currently in receipt of a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5010-5260 for limitation of flexion."
1814540P136S6,FindingSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"While either Diagnostic Code 5259 or 5260 may be applied, the highest available rating under Diagnostic Code 5259 in this case is 10 percent; thus, Diagnostic Code 5259 does not allow for a higher rating than the 10 percent disability rating currently assigned under Diagnostic Code 5010-5260 for osteoarthritis with limitation of flexion."
1814540P137S2,,Sentence,"The Board has also considered whether a higher disability rating was warranted at any point during the one year period prior to July 1, 2016, the date of claim for increase."
1814540P137S3,,CitationSentence,"See Hart, 21 Vet. App. 505."
1814540P137S4,,EvidenceSentence,The evidence of record does not indicate that the Veteran first became entitled to an increased disability rating for left knee osteoarthritis between July 2015 and July 2016.
1814540P137S5,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"As such, the appropriate effective date for the disability rating of 10 percent for left knee osteoarthritis is July 1, 2016, the date of claim."
1814540P137S6,,CitationSentence,"See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.400(o) (2017); Gaston, 605 F.3d at 984."
1814540P138S2,,Sentence,Extraschedular Referral Consideration
1814540P139S2,ReasoningSentence,FindingSentence,"The Board has considered whether referral for extraschedular consideration would have been warranted for the service-connected migraine headaches, PTSD, and left knee disabilities, for any part of the initial rating period on appeal."
1814540P139S3,,LegalRuleSentence,Ratings shall be based as far as practicable upon the average impairments of earning capacity with the additional proviso that the Secretary shall from time to time readjust this schedule of ratings in accordance with experience.
1814540P139S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"To accord justice, therefore, to the exceptional case where the schedular ratings are found to be inadequate, the Under Secretary for Benefits or the Director, Compensation and Pension Service, upon field station submission, is authorized to approve on the basis of the criteria set forth in this paragraph an extraschedular rating commensurate with the average earning capacity impairment due exclusively to the service-connected disability or disabilities."
1814540P139S5,LegalRuleSentence,FindingSentence,An extraschedular disability rating is warranted based upon a finding that the case presents such an exceptional or unusual disability picture with such related factors as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization that would render impractical the application of the regular schedular standards.
1814540P139S6,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.321(b)(1) (2017).
1814540P140S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,The Court has clarified that there is a three-step inquiry for determining whether a veteran is entitled to an extraschedular rating.
1814540P140S3,,CitationSentence,"Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111, 115 (2008)."
1814540P140S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"Initially, the Board must determine whether the evidence presents such an exceptional disability picture that the available schedular ratings for the service-connected disability are inadequate."
1814540P140S5,,CitationSentence,"See Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484 (2016); Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (holding that either the veteran must assert that a schedular rating is inadequate or the evidence must present exceptional or unusual circumstances); Sowers v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 472, 478 (2016) (""[t]he rating schedule must be deemed inadequate before extraschedular consideration is warranted"")."
1814540P140S6,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"Second, if the schedular rating does not contemplate the veteran's level of disability and symptomatology and is found inadequate, the Board must determine whether the veteran's disability picture exhibits other related factors such as marked interference with employment and frequent periods of hospitalization."
1814540P140S7,,CitationSentence,"Thun, 22 Vet. App. at 116."
1814540P140S8,,LegalRuleSentence,"Third, if the first two Thun elements have been satisfied, then the case must be referred to the Under Secretary for Benefits or the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service to determine whether, to accord justice, the veteran's disability picture requires the assignment of an extraschedular rating."
1814540P140S9,CitationSentence,Sentence,Thun at 116.
1814540P140S10,,LegalRuleSentence,"In other words, the first element of Thun compares a veteran's symptoms to the rating criteria, while the second element considers the resulting effects of those symptoms; if either prong is not met, then referral for extraschedular consideration is not appropriate."
1814540P140S11,,Sentence,"Yancy,"
1814540P141S2,,CitationSentence,27 Vet. App. at 494-95.
1814540P142S2,FindingSentence,ReasoningSentence,"With respect to the first prong of Thun, the Board finds that the symptomatology and impairment caused by the migraine headaches, PTSD, and left knee disabilities, are specifically contemplated by the schedular rating criteria, and no referral for extraschedular consideration is required."
1814540P142S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The migraine headaches have been manifested by two to three headaches a week that are managed with prescription medication, an average of one prostrating attack per month, and occasional absenteeism from work."
1814540P142S4,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,These symptoms are part of or similar to symptoms listed under the schedular rating criteria.
1814540P142S5,,CitationSentence,"See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.20 (schedular rating criteria provides for rating by analogy based on similar functions, anatomical location, and symptomatology)."
1814540P143S2,FindingSentence,ReasoningSentence,"The Board finds that the symptomatology and impairment caused by PTSD are specifically contemplated by the schedular rating criteria, and no referral for extraschedular consideration is required."
1814540P143S3,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"The schedular rating criteria, Diagnostic Code 9411, specifically provide for disability ratings based on a combination of history and clinical findings."
1814540P143S4,,EvidenceSentence,"In this case, considering the lay and medical evidence, PTSD has been manifested by moderate panic attacks, depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment with nightmares, mild reduction in recent memory, mildly tangential thoughts, suspiciousness, and irritability."
1814540P144S2,,ReasoningSentence,These symptoms and degree of social and occupational impairment are part of the schedular rating criteria.
1814540P144S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,The level of occupational and social impairment is explicitly part of the schedular rating criteria.
1814540P144S4,,ReasoningSentence,"Moreover, all the Veteran's psychiatric symptomatology is contemplated by the schedular rating criteria, which rates by analogy psychiatric symptoms that are ""like or similar to"" those explicitly listed in the schedular rating criteria."
1814540P144S5,,Sentence,Mauerhan at 443.
1814540P145S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The left knee osteoarthritis, rated under Diagnostic Code 5010-5260, has manifested primarily as osteoarthritis with painful limitation of flexion, normal extension, with tenderness."
1814540P145S3,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"The left knee instability rated under Diagnostic Code 5257 has manifested as slight and moderate subluxation, instability, giving way, and the use of a brace for stability."
1814540P145S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The meniscal and ACL dislocations are contemplated by Diagnostic Codes 5258 and 5259, which rate disabilities such as dislocation of the semilunar cartilage with symptoms of frequent locking, pain, and effusion, and removal of the semilunar cartilage which is symptomatic, respectively."
1814540P145S5,,ReasoningSentence,"The schedular rating criteria specifically contemplate such symptomatology and functional impairment, even though higher or separate ratings are not appropriate under other schedular rating criteria in this case for reasons explained in this Board decision."
1814540P145S6,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5010-5260, 5257, 5258, 5260, 5261; DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. 202."
1814540P146S2,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Further, any functional limitations imposed by the Veteran's left knee disabilities, which here include difficulty squatting, climbing stairs, weight bearing, and with prolonged walking and standing, are primarily the result of the left knee pain, and such pain is considered as part of the schedular rating criteria, to include as due to orthopedic (DeLuca and 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.40 , 4.45, 4.59) factors such as weakness or weakened movement, incoordination, and fatigability, which are incorporated into the schedular rating criteria as applied to the particular diagnostic code."
1814540P146S3,,CitationSentence,"See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991) (read together with schedular rating criteria, 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.40 and 4.45 recognize functional loss due to pain); Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 4 (2011) (the majority of 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.59, which is a schedular consideration rather than an extraschedular consideration, provides guidance for noting, evaluating, and rating joint pain); Sowers v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 472 (2016) (38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.59 is limited by the diagnostic code applicable to the claimant's disability, and is read in conjunction with, and subject to, the relevant diagnostic code); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 33-36 (2011) (pain alone does not constitute functional impairment under VA regulations, and the rating schedule contains several provisions, such as 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, that address functional loss in the musculoskeletal system as a result of pain and other orthopedic factors when applied to schedular rating criteria)."
1814540P147S2,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The effects of the Veteran's migraine headaches, PTSD, and left knee disabilities and associated limitations on occupational and daily life are specifically contemplated by the schedular criteria."
1814540P147S3,LegalRuleSentence,FindingSentence,The schedule is intended to compensate for average impairments in earning capacity resulting from service-connected disability in civil occupations.
1814540P147S4,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 1155.
1814540P147S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"""Generally, the degrees of disability specified [in the rating schedule] are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability."""
1814540P147S6,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.1.
1814540P148S2,,ReasoningSentence,"Comparing the Veteran's disability, symptomatology, and functional impairment of the migraine headaches, PTSD, and left knee disabilities to the rating schedule, the degree of disability throughout the entire period under consideration is contemplated by the rating schedule and the assigned ratings are, therefore, adequate."
1814540P148S3,,FindingSentence,"Absent any exceptional factors associated with the service-connected disabilities, the Board finds that the criteria for submission for assignment of an extraschedular rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.321 (b)(1) are not met."
1814540P148S4,,CitationSentence,"See Bagwell v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 337 (1996); Shipwash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 218, 227 (1995)."
1814540P149S2,,Sentence,"Lastly, the Board has considered whether the issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) was reasonably raised by the record in this case."
1814540P149S3,,CitationSentence,"Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009)."
1814540P149S4,,EvidenceSentence,"In this case, the Veteran testified that he is a retired postal worker; however, he maintains the ability to work without much stress or missing a significant amount of work due to the service-connected disabilities."
1814540P149S5,,CitationSentence,See October 2017 Board hearing transcript.
1814540P149S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, the record reflects that the Veteran reported an outstanding attendance record at work when he was employed."
1814540P150S2,,CitationSentence,See February 2006 VA examination report.
1814540P150S3,,EvidenceSentence,Neither the Veteran nor the evidence suggests unemployability due to the service-connected disabilities.
1814540P150S4,,CitationSentence,"Rice, 22 Vet. App. 447."
1814540P150S5,,FindingSentence,"Accordingly, the Board concludes that a claim for a TDIU has not been raised by the record."

1814950P26S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
1814950P27S2,,Sentence,The Board has thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in the Veteran's claims file.
1814950P27S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"In every decision, the Board must provide a statement of the reasons or bases for its determination, adequate to enable an appellant to understand the precise basis for the Board's decision, as well as to facilitate review by the Court."
1814950P27S4,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§ 7104(d)(1); see Allday v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 517, 527 (1995)."
1814950P27S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"Although the entire record must be reviewed by the Board, the Court has repeatedly found that the Board is not required to discuss, in detail, every piece of evidence."
1814950P27S6,,CitationSentence,"See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143, 149 (2001) (rejecting the notion that the Veterans Claims Assistance Act mandates that the Board discuss all evidence)."
1814950P27S7,,LegalRuleSentence,"Rather, the law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the appellant."
1814950P27S8,,CitationSentence,"See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000)."
1814950P27S9,,Sentence,"The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim."
1814950P27S10,,LegalRuleSentence,The appellant must not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed herein.
1814950P27S11,,CitationSentence,See id.
1814950P28S2,,FindingSentence,The Board finds that VA's duties to notify and assist have been met.
1814950P28S3,,Sentence,"Except as discussed herein, the Veteran has not raised issues with the duties to notify or assist."
1814950P28S4,,CitationSentence,"See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that ""the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board . . . to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board""); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to the duty to assist)."
1814950P28S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, while new evidence was received after the March 2017 Supplemental Statement of the Case, the Veteran waived RO consideration of the evidence."
1814950P29S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Further, the Veteran has not alleged any deficiency with the conduct of his hearing before the undersigned with respect to the duties discussed in Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488, 496-97 (2010)."
1814950P29S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"In this regard, the Federal Circuit ruled in Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2016) that a Bryant hearing deficiency was subject to the doctrine of issue exhaustion as laid out in Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015)."
1814950P29S4,,FindingSentence,"Thus, the Board need not discuss any potential Bryant problem because the Veteran has not raised that issue before the Board."
1814950P30S2,,EvidenceSentence,The pertinent regulations were provided to the Veteran in the Supplemental Statement of the Case and will not be repeated here.
1814950P31S2,,Sentence,Service Connection for PTSD
1814950P32S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran contends that he has a current diagnosis of PTSD related to stressors in-service, such as being racially-discriminated against and threatened by a superior officer."
1814950P32S3,EvidenceSentence,ReasoningSentence,"He testified that he did not complain about these incidents in service, which is why there is no record of them."
1814950P32S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, his sister submitted a statement contending that the Veteran was noticeably irritable, anxious, and depressed after he returned from service."
1814950P33S2,,FindingSentence,"The Board finds that the Veteran's testimony regarding racial discrimination and harassment in service is credible, but that the weight of the evidence does not link his PTSD to these stressors."
1814950P33S3,,EvidenceSentence,His service treatment records do not show treatment for or complaints of mental health issues and his psychiatric evaluation at separation was normal.
1814950P33S4,,EvidenceSentence,"In fact, the claims file does not show treatment for mental health issues until June 2005, when the Veteran was involved in a train accident."
1814950P34S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran filed a disability claim with his employer following the accident and the medical records are associated with the claims file.
1814950P34S3,,EvidenceSentence,"In August 2005, he was referred for a psychiatric evaluation and reported a history of traumatic events that were only related to his work as a locomotive engineer."
1814950P34S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The final event occurred in June 2005, in which the train he was conducting hit a dump truck that was stopped on the train tracks."
1814950P34S5,,EvidenceSentence,"He reported that he experienced immediate psychological distress after the accident, including sleep problems, exhaustion, doubt, and he stopped working."
1814950P34S6,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran reported that he was in ""good health"" before the accident."
1814950P34S7,,EvidenceSentence,"When discussing his military history, he did not report experiencing racism, harassment, or mental health issues during or as a result of his military service, and specifically denied a previous history of psychiatric or psychological treatment except marital counseling."
1814950P34S8,,EvidenceSentence,He only reported that he was promoted and received an honorable discharge.
1814950P34S9,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"Indeed, despite undergoing therapy sessions and psychiatric evaluations as a result of the accident and for his disability claim, the Veteran never mentioned his military service as an additional stressor."
1814950P34S10,,EvidenceSentence,These facts weigh heavily against any allegation he makes now that he experienced psychiatric symptoms ever since his military experiences.
1814950P34S11,,EvidenceSentence,"He was receiving psychiatric care and had ample opportunity to report such a history, yet he did not, and in fact he consistently linked onset of his psychiatric symptoms to his work-related stressors, especially the 2005 accident."
1814950P35S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In April 2009, the Veteran underwent a mental health evaluation at VA."
1814950P35S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner documented that he had no history of psychiatric issues ""until he was in a work-related accident"" in 2005."
1814950P35S4,,EvidenceSentence,"After the accident, he experienced marital conflict and subsequently separated from his wife."
1814950P35S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner further stated he became depressed ""[i]n the wake of the accident and the divorce."""
1814950P35S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Despite discussing his military history, the Veteran did not mention his military service as an additional stressor."
1814950P35S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner documented that the Veteran had re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms since the accident."
1814950P35S8,,EvidenceSentence,"Again, the fact that he did not report a history of symptoms related to any military incident weighs against his claim."
1814950P36S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In September 2009, the Veteran mentioned experiencing racial discrimination in the military, but did not discuss his military service as a PTSD stressor until approximately December 2011, after he filed his claim for service connection."
1814950P37S2,,EvidenceSentence,"VA obtained a medical opinion to assist in determining whether the Veteran's PTSD was related to service, but the examiner stated she could not say without speculation that his trauma-related disorder was related to service because there are no medical records indicating he was treated for trauma-related symptoms secondary to his tenure in the military and he was diagnosed with PTSD after a job-related accident."
1814950P37S3,CitationSentence,EvidenceSentence,"See, e.g., October 2006 letter from Mr. B., licensed counselor (""I am writing this letter to state unequivocally that [the Veteran] still suffers from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder from that accident....""); see also August 2005 psychiatric evaluation by Dr. B.C."
1814950P38S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In sum, the service treatment records do not show mental health issues in service, the post-service medical records do not show treatment for psychiatric issues until the June 2005 accident, post-accident psychiatric evaluations relate his PTSD to his accident, and, while seeking medical treatment, the Veteran consistently reported that he did not experience psychiatric issues until the accident."
1814950P38S3,,EvidenceSentence,These statements he made in the course of receiving psychiatric care long before filing his claim with VA carry significant weight.
1814950P38S4,,ReasoningSentence,The Veteran's credibility is also affected by the fact that he made one assertion when seeking benefits from the railroad disability board (that his PTSD was due to the 2005 accident) and that he now states differently when seeking benefits from VA (that his PTSD was due to service).
1814950P39S1,ReasoningSentence,ReasoningSentence,"The Board considered the evidence supporting his claim, including his testimony, lay statements, and the September 2013 and March 2016 private psychiatric evaluations by Dr. H."
1814950P39S3,,EvidenceSentence,"As discussed extensively above, the psychiatric records prior to his VA claim show consistent reports of onset of psychiatric symptoms following the 2005 accident."
1814950P40S2,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,The Board accorded the psychiatric evaluations by Dr. H. little probative value because they are clearly based on an inaccurate and incomplete history.
1814950P40S3,,EvidenceSentence,Dr. H. did not indicate he reviewed any of the records associated with the Veteran's prior psychiatric treatment.
1814950P40S4,,ReasoningSentence,This is critically important in this case because Dr. H.'s opinions do not address or even mention the June 2005 accident.
1814950P40S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Every other medical record demonstrates this accident was a significant stressor for him and, according to the Veteran, triggered the onset of his psychiatric issues."
1814950P40S6,,EvidenceSentence,The fact that Dr. H. apparently did not know about this accident (as it is not mentioned in his letters) means his opinion that the Veteran's PTSD was related to service was woefully uninformed.
1814950P40S7,,ReasoningSentence,"To the extent Dr. H. relied on the Veteran's report that he had experienced nightmares and other PTSD symptoms since service, the Board also finds that those statements lack probative value."
1814950P40S8,,EvidenceSentence,"As discussed above, in years of psychiatric treatment before filing his claim with VA, the Veteran repeatedly dated onset of his symptoms to the 2005 accident."
1814950P40S9,,EvidenceSentence,"If he had, in fact, been experiencing nightmares for almost 30 years, it is reasonable to expect he would have reported this to his mental health providers."
1814950P40S10,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"The fact that he not only never mentioned a decades-long history of nightmares, but that he affirmatively dated onset of symptoms to the 2005 accident, means his statements to Dr. H. were simply not credible."
1814950P40S11,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Therefore, Dr. H.'s opinions were based not only on an inaccurate history the Veteran gave him concerning his symptoms, but also on an inaccurate history of his stressors, since he was apparently not informed about the 2005 accident."
1814950P41S2,,FindingSentence,"In consideration of the medical and lay evidence, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence weighs against service connection for PTSD."
1814950P41S3,,ReasoningSentence,"In making this determination, the Board finds that the service treatment records, post-accident disability and medical records, and the Veteran's statements made seeking disability from his former employer outweigh his statements and the private psychiatric evaluations."
1814950P41S4,,FindingSentence,"Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted and the claim must be denied."
1814950P41S5,,FindingSentence,"Again, the Board finds credible the Veteran's history of experiencing racial discrimination issues during service, but this did not cause his PTSD."
1814950P42S2,,Sentence,Service Connection for Sleep Apnea
1814950P43S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for sleep apnea on a direct or secondary basis.
1814950P43S3,,EvidenceSentence,"During the Board hearing, he testified that he has had trouble sleeping since service and his fellow service members witnessed him snoring."
1814950P43S4,,Sentence,"As the claim for PTSD is being denied, the Board will not discuss the Veteran's secondary claim."
1814950P44S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In support of his contentions, he has submitted numerous lay statements from coworkers, friends, and family."
1814950P44S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Relevantly, his sister stated that she lived at home when the Veteran returned from the military and she witnessed him snoring excessively at night following by periods of complete silence where he stopped breathing."
1814950P45S2,,FindingSentence,The Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against service connection for sleep apnea.
1814950P45S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The service treatment records, which appear to be complete, do not show complaints of or treatment for relevant symptoms, and a sleep-related disorder was not noted on the separation examination."
1814950P46S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Post-service treatment records received by the Railroad Retirement Board document sleep complaints related to his PTSD but no complaints specific to sleep apnea, such as gasping for air or snoring."
1814950P46S3,,EvidenceSentence,"VA treatment records show that he complained about difficulty falling and staying asleep in April 2009, but did not report issues with snoring and gasping for air until August 2011."
1814950P46S4,,EvidenceSentence,He underwent a sleep study and was ultimately diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea in January 2012.
1814950P46S5,,EvidenceSentence,"At the sleep study, he reported experiencing difficulty sleeping and staying awake and daytime somnolence for years, but did not relate it to service at that time."
1814950P47S2,,Sentence,The Board considered the Veteran's contentions and the lay statements that support his claim.
1814950P47S3,,ReasoningSentence,"To the extent that they allege the Veteran has been experiencing sleep apnea since service, the Board finds that these statements are inconsistent with other evidence in the claims file and therefore lack probative value."
1814950P47S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Specifically, the Veteran's service records and separation examination did not document sleep-related problems, and he did not complain about symptoms specific to sleep apnea until approximately August 2011, despite seeking earlier treatment for sleep-related issues."
1814950P47S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, in November 2005, during a psychiatric evaluation, the Veteran reported that his sleeping problems began after the June 2005 accident."
1814950P47S6,,ReasoningSentence,The Board thus did not rely on these statements when making its decision.
1814950P48S2,,FindingSentence,"In consideration of the competent and credible evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's sleep apnea did not begin in service and the claim for service connection for sleep apnea is denied."
1814950P49S1,,Sentence,ORDER
1814950P50S2,,Sentence,Service connection for PTSD is denied.
1814950P51S2,,Sentence,Service connection for sleep apnea is denied.

1815018P11S2,,Sentence,"Appellant represented by:Stacey P. Clark, Attorney"
1815018P12S1,,Sentence,ATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD
1815018P13S2,,Sentence,"S. Owen, Associate Counsel"
1815018P14S1,,Sentence,INTRODUCTION
1815018P15S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran served on active duty from December 1966 to December 1969.
1815018P16S2,,FindingSentence,"This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2012 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida, which, in pertinent part, denied service connection for anxiety disorder, NOS (claimed as PTSD, mood swings, and anxiety attacks) and entitlement to a total disability rating."
1815018P16S3,,Sentence,The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement (NOD) in August 2012 for the denial of service connection for a psychiatric disability.
1815018P17S2,,Sentence,"This matter also comes before the Board on appeal from an August 2014 rating decision of the RO in Huntington, West Virginia, which denied service connection for sleep apnea secondary to PTSD."
1815018P17S3,,Sentence,"Jurisdiction remained with the St. Petersburg, Florida RO."
1815018P17S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran filed a timely NOD in September 2014.
1815018P18S2,,EvidenceSentence,"As to the claim for a TDIU, in a July 2012 letter, the Veteran indicated that he wished to withdraw his pending claim for TDIU."
1815018P18S3,,Sentence,"However, the RO adjudicated the claim in the July 2012 rating decision."
1815018P18S4,,Sentence,"In August 2012, the Veteran filed a NOD with the denial of service connection for a psychiatric disability and the RO construed the NOD as one for TDIU as well."
1815018P18S5,,EvidenceSentence,"In September 2012, the RO sent the Veteran a letter in which it acknowledged the Veteran's withdrawal of his NOD for TDIU and that no further action would be taken on the claim."
1815018P18S6,,EvidenceSentence,"However, the RO included the issue of entitlement to TDIU in a February 2014 statement of the case and the Veteran filed a VA Form 9 in March 2014."
1815018P19S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In a June 2015 decision, the Board found that given the RO's actions in continuing to adjudicate the TDIU claim after his July 2012 letter, the fact that there was no notice of disagreement at the time of the July 2012 letter, and his actions indicating a desire to continue the appeal once the RO undertook to adjudicate the claim after the July 2012 letter, the TDIU issue remained on appeal."
1815018P19S3,,Sentence,"Therefore, this claim is properly before the Board on appeal."
1815018P20S2,,Sentence,"In the June 2015 decision, the Board also remanded the case for further development of the record, including obtaining a VA examination and medical opinion."
1815018P20S3,,Sentence,There has been substantial compliance with the requested development.
1815018P20S4,,CitationSentence,"Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998); see Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141 (1999)."
1815018P21S2,,Sentence,"In an August 2017 rating decision, and during the pendency of the appeal, the RO granted service connection for PTSD."
1815018P21S3,,Sentence,"As a grant of service connection represents a grant of the benefits sought on appeal for this claim, this claim is no longer before the Board."
1815018P21S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Board notes that the Veteran has filed a NOD with the effective date and disability rating assigned for his PTSD.
1815018P21S5,,EvidenceSentence,"As the NOD was filed recently, the RO must be given time to respond to the NOD; therefore, the increased rating and earlier effective date claims remain before the RO."
1815018P22S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In October 2017 and January 2018, and subsequent to the August 2017 supplemental statement of the case, the Veteran submitted additional evidence in support of his claim for sleep apnea without waiver of initial RO review, and his claim for TDIU with a waiver of initial RO review."
1815018P22S3,,ReasoningSentence,"However, as the Board is remanding these claims as discussed below, the RO will have an opportunity to review all the submitted documents."
1815018P23S2,,Sentence,This appeal was processed using the Virtual VA and Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) paperless claims processing system.
1815018P23S3,,Sentence,"Accordingly, any future consideration of this case should take into consideration the existence of this electronic record."
1815018P24S1,,Sentence,The issues of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea secondary to service-connected PTSD and entitlement to TDIU are addressed in the REMAND portion of the decision below and are REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).
1815018P25S1,,Sentence,FINDING OF FACT
1815018P26S2,,FindingSentence,"The preponderance of the evidence reflects that the Veteran does not have an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD due to any injury, disease or incident of his active duty service."
1815018P27S1,,Sentence,CONCLUSION OF LAW
1815018P28S2,,FindingSentence,The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD have not been met.
1815018P28S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1101, 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (2017); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304 (2017)."
1815018P29S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION
1815018P30S2,,Sentence,Duties to Notify and Assist
1815018P31S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), in part, describes VA's duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits."
1815018P31S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5100, 5103, 5013A, 5106, 5107, 5126 (2012); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2017)."
1815018P31S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"Upon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, VA is required to notify the claimant and his or her representative of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide."
1815018P31S5,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.159(b).
1815018P31S6,,LegalRuleSentence,VCAA notice should be provided to a claimant before the initial unfavorable agency of original jurisdiction decision on a claim.
1815018P31S7,,CitationSentence,"Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006)."
1815018P32S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,The Veteran was advised of VA's duties to notify and assist in the development of the claim at issue by notice letter dated in May 2011.
1815018P32S3,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5102, 5103, 5103A (2012); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.159 (2017); see also Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015)."
1815018P33S2,,LegalRuleSentence,The VCAA also provides that VA has a duty to assist claimants in obtaining evidence needed to substantiate a claim.
1815018P33S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 5103A; 38 C.F.R Â§ 3.159(c).
1815018P33S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Here, the Veteran's service records, VA records, and private treatment records identified by the Veteran have been obtained and associated with the claims file."
1815018P33S5,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for a mental disorder other than PTSD in June 2010.
1815018P33S6,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,The examination is of record.
1815018P33S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran was afforded VA examinations for PTSD in February 2012, April 2016, June 2017 and July 2017."
1815018P33S8,,EvidenceSentence,Those examinations are also of record.
1815018P33S9,,LegalRuleSentence,"To that end, when VA undertakes to either provide an examination or to obtain an opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate."
1815018P33S10,,CitationSentence,"Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007)."
1815018P33S11,,EvidenceSentence,"The VA examination reports reflect that relevant records were reviewed and the examiners personally interviewed and examined the Veteran, including eliciting a history from him, and offered opinions."
1815018P34S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"The Veteran has been afforded a meaningful opportunity to participate effectively in the processing of the claim, including by submission of statements and arguments."
1815018P34S3,FindingSentence,ReasoningSentence,"Based upon the foregoing, the duties to notify and assist the Veteran have been met, and no further action is necessary to assist the Veteran in substantiating this claim."
1815018P35S2,,Sentence,Service Connection Laws and Regulations
1815018P36S2,,LegalRuleSentence,Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.
1815018P36S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(a).

1815018P42S2,,Sentence,Analysis
1815018P43S2,,Sentence,The Veteran contends that service connection is warranted for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.
1815018P43S3,EvidenceSentence,FindingSentence,The Board notes that the Veteran has been service-connected for PTSD.
1815018P44S2,,EvidenceSentence,"On his October 1966 induction examination and October 1969 separation examination, the Veteran denied depression or excessive worry and nervous trouble of any sort."
1815018P44S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Upon objective examination, there were no findings of an abnormal psychiatric examination in October 1966, and upon separation, his psychiatric examination was normal."
1815018P44S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for complaints of or treatment for a psychiatric disorder.
1815018P45S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Post-service VA treatment records reflect that in June 2005, the Veteran was examined for, but found to not have, major depressive disorder."
1815018P45S3,,EvidenceSentence,"In January 2010, the Veteran denied anxiety, but reported having nightmares and mood swings."
1815018P45S4,,EvidenceSentence,"In May 2010, he was diagnosed with moderate, recurrent major depressive disorder, rule out PTSD."
1815018P46S2,,EvidenceSentence,A June 2010 VA examination report reflects that the Veteran had been treated for major depression and that the Veteran reported being stressed and depressed after moving his family from New York to Puerto Rico ten years prior.
1815018P46S3,,EvidenceSentence,"However, he denied any significant anxiety."
1815018P46S4,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner disagreed with the Veteran's diagnosis of major depressive disorder and instead diagnosed the Veteran with an adjustment disorder with depressed mood due to situational stressors and transitions.
1815018P46S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Furthermore, as the Veteran denied treatment for a mental disorder in service, and the examiner's finding that the Veteran's adjustment disorder with depressed mood was relatively recent and due to situational stressors, the examiner opined that the Veteran's adjustment disorder was not caused by or a result of service."
1815018P47S2,,EvidenceSentence,VA treatment records reflect continued treatment for mental health.
1815018P47S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's depressive disorder was noted to be resolved, but he continued to be diagnosed with anxiety disorder, NOS, with PTSD symptoms."
1815018P47S4,,CitationSentence,"See March 2011, November 2011, and January 2012 VA treatment records."
1815018P48S2,,EvidenceSentence,"A February 2012 examination report reflects that the Veteran reported experiencing a depressive affect, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping but denied suicidal or homicidal ideation or visual or auditory hallucinations."
1815018P48S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran reported experiencing PTSD symptoms such as intrusive memories, nightmares, flashbacks, avoidance symptoms, and increased arousal symptoms."
1815018P48S4,,EvidenceSentence,"However, the examiner found that these symptoms were not significant for PTSD when scored under the DSM-IV criteria."
1815018P48S5,,EvidenceSentence,"As the Veteran's treatment records reflected that his depression appeared resolved, the VA examiner offered a diagnosis of anxiety disorder, NOS, to encompass the Veteran's symptoms, but found that it would resort to mere speculation to opine as to whether the Veteran's anxiety disorder was related to his conceded military combat stressor."
1815018P49S2,,EvidenceSentence,VA treatment records show continued treatment for anxiety disorder with symptoms of depression and PTSD.
1815018P49S3,CitationSentence,EvidenceSentence,"See May 2012, February 2013, April 2013, May 2013, and July 2013 VA treatment records; see also December 2016 letter of Dr. W.G."
1815018P50S2,,EvidenceSentence,"An April 2016 VA examination report reflects that the examiner determined that a diagnosis of PTSD or an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD could not be made, as test results indicated that the Veteran was not cooperative or possibly feigning symptoms."
1815018P50S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner noted that although the Veteran was not diagnosed with PTSD during the examination, it did not mean that he did not have PTSD."
1815018P50S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner further noted that although the Veteran's mental health provider had diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD, there was no evidence that the treatment provider made an attempt to assess the veracity of the Veteran's reported symptoms."
1815018P51S2,,EvidenceSentence,"July 2017 VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD, and that his previously diagnosed major depressive disorder was in remission."
1815018P52S2,,EvidenceSentence,"A July 2017 VA examination report reflects that the examiner found that the Veteran had symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, and disturbances of motivation and mood, but no other symptoms attributable to PTSD or other mental disorder."
1815018P52S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner found that the Veteran endorsed signs and symptoms of PTSD per the DSM-V, including participating in combat, discharging his weapon, and exposure to people being hurt and killed."
1815018P52S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner noted that the Veteran was able to keep a job for 33 years until retirement, had been married for 46 years, and had close ties with his family."
1815018P52S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran had no history of acute psychiatric inpatient care, denied suicidal or homicidal ideas or plans, and did not exhibit signs of psychosis."
1815018P52S6,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner concluded that the Veteran had mild symptoms of PTSD and that the Veteran's PTSD was most likely incurred in or caused by service.
1815018P52S7,,EvidenceSentence,"However, the examiner found that at the time of the examination, the Veteran did not exhibit another and/or comorbid mental condition other than PTSD."
1815018P52S8,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms were accounted for with the PTSD diagnosis.
1815018P53S2,,FindingSentence,"In this case, the preponderance of the evidence indicates that the Veteran does not have an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD."
1815018P53S3,,EvidenceSentence,"His VA treatment records note an initial diagnosis of major depressive disorder, rule out PTSD."
1815018P53S4,,EvidenceSentence,Subsequent VA treatment records reflect a diagnosis of anxiety disorder with PTSD symptoms.
1815018P54S2,,EvidenceSentence,"However, additional treatment records reflect that his major depressive disorder resolved."
1815018P54S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Significantly, the July 2017 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD, found that the Veteran did not have more than one mental disorder diagnosed, and that all of the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms were associated with his PTSD."
1815018P55S2,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder other than PTSD."
1815018P55S3,FindingSentence,Sentence,The first element of a service connection claim is not satisfied with regard to an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.
1815018P55S4,,CitationSentence,"Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67."
1815018P55S5,,LegalRuleSentence,The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.

1815018P55S7,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,In the absence of evidence of a current disability there can be no valid claim.
1815018P55S8,,CitationSentence,"Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); see McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007) (finding that the requirement for a current disability is satisfied if the claimant has a disability at the time a claim was filed or at any time during the pendency of the appeal, even if the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim)."
1815018P56S2,FindingSentence,ReasoningSentence,"The Board notes that even if the Veteran met the first element of a service connection claim, such that he had a currently diagnosed psychiatric disorder other than PTSD, his claim for service connection would not meet the third element."
1815018P56S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The June 2010 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as an adjustment disorder, was not caused by or a result of service, but was relatively recent and due to situational stressors."
1815018P56S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, the February 2012 VA examiner was unable to opine that the Veteran's anxiety disorder was related to his military stressors, as doing so would resort to mere speculation."
1815018P56S5,,FindingSentence,"Thus, the Veteran's previously diagnosed psychiatric conditions have not been shown to be related to service."
1815018P57S2,,Sentence,
1815018P58S2,,FindingSentence,"Accordingly, the preponderance of the evidence of record does not show that the Veteran has a diagnosis for VA purposes of an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD, which is related to active service."
1815018P58S3,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, the Board finds that the service connection is not warranted."
1815018P58S4,,CitationSentence,"Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990)."
1815018P59S1,,Sentence,ORDER
1815018P60S2,,Sentence,Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD is denied.
1815018P61S1,,Sentence,REMAND
1815018P62S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran contends that service connection is warranted for his sleep apnea.
1815018P62S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Specifically, he contends that his sleep apnea is secondary to his service-connected PTSD."
1815018P63S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was afforded a VA medical opinion in April 2016.
1815018P63S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran was not examined in person, and the opinion was based upon a review of the medical evidence, including the Veteran's service treatment records and claims folder, and the medical literature."
1815018P63S4,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted that the Veteran had been diagnosed with sleep apnea in 2011.
1815018P63S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner explained that sleep apnea is an anatomical/physiological disorder most commonly caused by airflow obstruction from the oropharynx to the lungs, and is commonly manifested by loud snoring, frequent sleep interruption, daytime moodiness, lack of concentration, and daytime headache."
1815018P63S6,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner further explained that PTSD is a mental health diagnosis which has no nexus with the physiologic/anatomic changes that are at the root of sleep apnea, and the disordered sleep that may result from PTSD does not produce the same symptoms of sleep apnea."
1815018P63S7,,EvidenceSentence,"Thus, the examiner opined that there was no secondary service connection for sleep apnea due to PTSD."
1815018P64S2,,ReasoningSentence,The Board finds that the April 2016 opinion is inadequate.
1815018P64S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Although the examiner opined that the Veteran's sleep apnea was not caused by the Veteran's PTSD, the examiner did not render an opinion as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea is aggravated by his PTSD."
1815018P65S2,,EvidenceSentence,VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran is on mirtazapine for his mood and sleep.
1815018P65S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran reported that since being on the medication, he has had an increase in his nightmares and that he would rip off his c-pap tubing in his sleep."
1815018P65S4,,CitationSentence,See June 2017 VA treatment records.
1815018P65S5,,Sentence,"In addition, the Veteran's representative has submitted additional citations to medical studies and literature in support of the Veteran's claim, with the most recent study dated in 2017, and subsequent to the April 2016 VA medical opinion."
1815018P65S6,,CitationSentence,See October 2017 correspondence.
1815018P66S2,,FindingSentence,"As such, the Board finds that a remand is warranted for a new medical opinion as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea is caused by or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD, to include any medications he takes to treat his PTSD."
1815018P67S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"With regard to the issue of entitlement to a TDIU, a decision on the service connection claim for sleep apnea being remanded herein, as well as the increased rating claim for PTSD pending before the RO, may affect the claim for a TDIU."
1815018P67S3,,Sentence,Any grant of an increased rating claim or service connection claim could significantly change the adjudication of the TDIU issue because such a grant could increase the Veteran's overall combined disability percentage.
1815018P67S4,,CitationSentence,"See Parker v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 116 (1994); Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (issues are ""inextricably intertwined"" when a decision on one issue would have a ""significant impact"" on a veteran's claim for the second issue)."
1815018P67S5,,LegalRuleSentence,Consideration of entitlement to a TDIU must therefore be deferred until the intertwined issues are resolved or prepared for appellate consideration.
1815018P67S6,,CitationSentence,"See id. (where a claim is inextricably intertwined with another claim, the claims must be adjudicated together)."
1815018P68S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Any outstanding, pertinent VA treatment records and private records identified by the Veteran should be obtained and associated with the Veteran's electronic claims file."
1815018P68S3,,EvidenceSentence,The most recent VA treatment records on file are dated in August 2017.
1815018P69S1,,Sentence,"Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:"
1815018P70S2,,Sentence,1.
1815018P70S3,,EvidenceSentence,Obtain and associate with the Veteran's electronic claims file any outstanding VA treatment records dated since August 2017 and any private treatment records identified by the Veteran.
1815018P71S2,,Sentence,2.
1815018P71S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Then, return the Veteran's claims file to the April 2016 VA examiner for an addendum opinion concerning the nature and etiology of the Veteran's diagnosed sleep apnea."
1815018P71S4,,EvidenceSentence,"If the examiner is no longer available, the claims file should be provided to an examiner qualified to render an opinion on the Veteran's sleep apnea."
1815018P71S5,,Sentence,A new examination is only required if deemed necessary by the examiner.
1815018P71S6,,EvidenceSentence,"The record and a copy of this remand must be made available to the examiner for review, and the examiner must specifically acknowledge receipt and review of these materials in any reports generated."
1815018P72S2,,EvidenceSentence,"If a new examination is conducted, the examiner must take a detailed history from the Veteran."
1815018P72S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"If there is any clinical or medical basis for corroborating or discounting the reliability of the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner must so state, with complete explanation in support of such a finding."
1815018P73S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner must opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent or greater possibility) that the Veteran's sleep apnea is caused or aggravated (i.e., permanently worsened beyond the normal progression of the disability) by his service-connected PTSD, to include any medication the Veteran takes to treat his PTSD."
1815018P73S3,,EvidenceSentence,"If the examiner finds that the Veteran's sleep apnea is aggravated by his PTSD, then he or she should quantify the degree of aggravation, if possible."
1815018P74S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner must provide a comprehensive report including complete rationales for all opinions and conclusions, based on his or her clinical experience, medical expertise, and established medical principles."
1815018P74S3,,EvidenceSentence,"If the examiner is unable to provide the requested opinions without resorting to speculation, the reasons for the inability to provide the necessary opinion should be provided."
1815018P74S4,,EvidenceSentence,Any missing evidence that would enable the examiner to provide the opinion should be identified.
1815018P75S2,,FindingSentence,"The examiner is advised that the term ""as likely as not"" does not mean within the realm of possibility."
1815018P75S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Rather, it means that the weight of medical evidence both for and against a conclusion is so evenly divided that it is medically sound to find in favor of causation as to find against causation."
1815018P75S4,,Sentence,More likely and as likely support the causal relationship.
1815018P75S5,,Sentence,Less likely weighs against the claim.
1815018P76S2,,Sentence,3.
1815018P76S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"After completing the above, and any other development as may be indicated, the Veteran's claims of service connection for sleep apnea secondary to service-connected PTSD and entitlement to a TDIU should be readjudicated based on the entirety of the evidence."
1815018P76S4,,Sentence,"If the claim remains denied, the Veteran and his representative should be issued a supplemental statement of the case (SSOC)."
1815018P76S5,,Sentence,An appropriate period of time should be allowed for response.
1815018P76S6,,Sentence,"Thereafter, the case should be returned to the Board for further appellate consideration, if otherwise in order."
1815018P77S2,,Sentence,The appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matters the Board has remanded.
1815018P77S3,,CitationSentence,"Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999)."
1815018P78S2,,ReasoningSentence,These claims must be afforded expeditious treatment.
1815018P78S3,,LegalRuleSentence,The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

1815167P14S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran served on active duty from May 1968 to September 1969.
1815167P15S2,,Sentence,"These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2009 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Boise, Idaho."
1815167P16S2,,Sentence,"In March 2009, the RO granted service connection for PTSD, evaluated as 30 percent disabling effective January 28, 2009."
1815167P16S3,,EvidenceSentence,"In December 2017, the RO increased the rating from 30 percent to 50 percent effective from January 28, 2009."
1815167P16S4,,EvidenceSentence,"However, since this increase did not constitute a full grant of the benefit sought, the higher initial evaluation issue remains in appellate status."
1815167P16S5,,CitationSentence,"AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 39 (1993)."
1815167P17S2,,Sentence,This matter was previously remanded by the Board in April 2016.

1815167P19S2,,Sentence,1.
1815167P19S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's PTSD was manifested by symptoms productive of functional impairment comparable to occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

1815167P29S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,Service connection is in effect for PTSD at a 50 percent disability rating effective from December 2017.
1815167P29S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran claims that his service-connected PTSD is more severe than his current evaluation.
1815167P30S2,LegalRuleSentence,CitationSentence,Evaluations for psychiatric disabilities are assigned pursuant to 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130.
1815167P30S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Under the general rating formula for mental disorders,  a 50 percent rating is warranted for PTSD where there is occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory such as, retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks; impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships."
1815167P30S4,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130, DC 9411."
1815167P31S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A 70 percent rating for PTSD contemplates occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships."
1815167P31S3,,CitationSentence,Id.
1815167P32S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Finally, a 100 percent disability rating is warranted for PTSD resulting in total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name."
1815167P32S3,,CitationSentence,Id.
1815167P33S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"In evaluating the evidence, the Board has considered the various Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores that clinicians have assigned."
1815167P33S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The GAF is a scale reflecting the psychological, social, and occupational functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental health illness."
1815167P33S4,,CitationSentence,"See Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) (DSM-IV); Carpenter v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 240 (1995)."
1815167P33S5,,EvidenceSentence,"A GAF score in the range of 51-60 indicates ""Moderate symptoms (e.g., flat affect and circumstantial speech, occasional panic attacks) OR moderate difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., few friends, conflicts with peers or co-workers)."""
1815167P34S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Turning to the merits of the claim, in a February 2009 Pocatello CBOC treatment record, the Veteran reported stress starting to wear on him."
1815167P34S3,,EvidenceSentence,"On mental status examination, speech was a normal rate and tone."
1815167P34S4,,EvidenceSentence,He denied suicidal or homicidal ideations or plans.
1815167P34S5,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,Cognition was intact retention and focus.
1815167P34S6,,EvidenceSentence,He was assigned a GAF of 50.
1815167P35S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In April 2009, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination."
1815167P35S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Following an examination and review of the claims file, the examiner noted the Veteran continues to have disturbing memories and thoughts of events that occurred in Vietnam."
1815167P35S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Following a mental status examination, the Veteran's mood was moderately anxious and depressed."
1815167P35S5,,EvidenceSentence,His form of thought was linear and goal directed.
1815167P35S6,,EvidenceSentence,No inappropriate behavior was noted.
1815167P35S7,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted that the best description of the Veteran's current psychiatric impairment is that his symptoms are best described as an occasional and social impairment with occasional reduction in work efficiency and intermittent period of inability to perform occasional tasks.
1815167P36S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In the March 2010 VA Form 9, the Veteran stated that he does not socialize with friends and does not have any one who comes over."
1815167P36S3,,EvidenceSentence,He noted that he has been unable to maintain a relationship with a woman for more than nine months since service.
1815167P37S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was afforded another VA mental health examination in April 2011.
1815167P37S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran endorsed difficulty motivating himself, unable to be around others/crowds, and nightmares."
1815167P37S4,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted the Veteran's mood was normal but appeared anxious.
1815167P37S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran did not exhibit psychosis, and denied auditory and visual hallucinations."
1815167P37S6,,EvidenceSentence,He was clean and well groomed.
1815167P37S7,,EvidenceSentence,"Symptoms include recurrent dreams, anxiety, panic attacks, restless sleep, and hyperarousal."
1815167P37S8,,EvidenceSentence,"Following examination, the examiner found that the best description of the Veteran's current psychiatric impairment is that his symptoms cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most of the following areas: work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and mood and other symptoms."
1815167P37S9,,EvidenceSentence,"The report noted there is reduced reliability and productivity due to PTSD signs and symptoms such as difficulty in understanding complex commands, disturbances of motivation and mood, impaired judgment, and difficulty establishing and maintaining relationships."
1815167P38S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In an August 2011 treatment note, the Veteran reported staying as busy as possible and living a valued and meaningful life."
1815167P38S3,,EvidenceSentence,He reported seeing a therapist is helpful.
1815167P39S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In a December 2011 addendum opinion, three board physicians disagreed with the conclusion of the April 2011 examiner."
1815167P39S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Following review of the claims file, the physicians noted the evidence shows an overall improvement in psychosocial functioning, with a reduction in mental health symptoms."
1815167P39S4,,EvidenceSentence,The physicians opined that the Veteran's current psychiatric impairment is best described as an occasional decrease in work efficiency or intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks due to signs and symptoms of PTSD.
1815167P39S5,,EvidenceSentence,A GAF of 60 was assigned.
1815167P40S2,EvidenceSentence,ReasoningSentence,A June 2015 Salt Lake City VAMC treatment record notes the Veteran's PTSD is stable on medications.
1815167P41S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In November 2017, the most recent VA mental health examination of the Veteran was conducted."
1815167P41S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran reported feeling satisfied with his social life.
1815167P41S4,,EvidenceSentence,He regularly has others visit him and rarely feels lonely.
1815167P41S5,,EvidenceSentence,"He noted some difficulty with authority, but reported that overall he gets along fairly well with others."
1815167P41S6,,EvidenceSentence,He described an active social life prior to and during his military service.
1815167P41S7,,EvidenceSentence,"He has had panic attacks, but noted that these are rare and only occur at night after having a nightmare."
1815167P41S8,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted the Veteran's hygiene and grooming were adequate.
1815167P41S9,,EvidenceSentence,Affect was flat but mood was euthymic.
1815167P41S10,,EvidenceSentence,"Symptoms attributable to the Veteran's PTSD included anxiety, depressed mood, suspiciousness, panic attacks, difficulty in understanding complex commands, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, and difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting."
1815167P41S11,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner indicated that his level of functioning was occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation."
1815167P42S2,,FindingSentence,The preponderance of the evidence is against the assignment of a disability rating in excess of 50 percent for the service-connected PTSD for any period of time covered by the appeal.
1815167P42S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Throughout the period of this claim, manifestations of the Veteran's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) include sleep disturbance, nightmares, anxiety, depressed mood, suspiciousness, and panic attacks."
1815167P42S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Furthermore, while the Veteran reported disliking crowds, he maintained good relationships with friends."
1815167P42S5,,EvidenceSentence,"He was consistently well groomed and hygienic; his thought process was intact; there was no evidence of paranoia, delusions, or hallucination; and he denied suicidal and homicidal ideation."
1815167P42S6,,EvidenceSentence,"Furthermore, the Veteran's assigned GAF scores during the period were between 50 and 60, which is indicative of (very generally) moderate symptoms."
1815167P42S7,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, the above-described evidence, notably the November 2017 VA examination, does not document that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms result in occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas."
1815167P43S2,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board has also fully considered the lay statements of record, which are competent insofar as they relate to observable symptoms."
1815167P43S3,,CitationSentence,"See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994)."
1815167P43S4,,ReasoningSentence,"Notably, however, the lay evidence of record is not competent to provide an expert opinion as to the Veteran's level of functional impairment as a result of his observable PTSD symptoms."
1815167P43S5,,CitationSentence,"See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007)."
1815167P43S6,,ReasoningSentence,"Therefore, it is afforded less probative value than the objective psychiatric medical evidence of record."
1815167P44S2,,ReasoningSentence,"In this regard, it is important for the Veteran to understand that this finding does not suggest he does not have problems with PTSD."
1815167P44S3,,EvidenceSentence,"A fifty percent evaluation is a significant disability, which will cause him many problems, as he has noted."
1815167P44S4,,ReasoningSentence,Without taking into consideration the problems he has cited there would be no basis for the current finding.
1815167P44S5,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"The only question in this case is the degree of disability, not whether the Veteran has PTSD."
1815167P45S2,,FindingSentence,"Accordingly, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 50 percent is not warranted for any period of time covered by the appeal."
1815167P45S3,,FindingSentence,"In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the preponderance of the evidence during the appeal period is against the Veteran's claim for a disability rating in excess of 50 percent for his service-connected PTSD, the doctrine is not for application."
1815167P45S4,,CitationSentence,"Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990)."
1815167P46S2,,ReasoningSentence,"Furthermore, neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record."
1815167P46S3,CitationSentence,ReasoningSentence,"See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record)."
1815167P46S4,,Sentence,The Board notes the issue of TDIU is discussed below.
1815167P47S2,,Sentence,II.
1815167P47S3,,Sentence,TDIU
1815167P48S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran contends that he is unemployable as a result of his service-connected disabilities.
1815167P48S3,EvidenceSentence,ReasoningSentence,"Specifically, the Veteran states that TDIU is due to his service-connected PTSD."
1815167P48S4,,ReasoningSentence,"However, the Board will consider all service-connected disabilities with his TDIU claim."
1815167P49S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"The Board may assign a TDIU in the first instance provided that certain schedular disability ratings requirements, such as a combined disability rating of 70 percent with at least one disability rating as 40 percent rating, are met."
1815167P49S3,,CitationSentence,"See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(a); see also Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 10 (2001) (holding that the Board may not assign a TDIU in the first instance when the schedular requirements of 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(a) are not met)."
1815167P50S2,,FindingSentence,"The Veteran is presently in receipt of service connection for PTSD, rated as 50 percent disabling, tinnitus, rated as 10 percent disabling, erectile dysfunction, rated as noncompensable, diabetes mellitus, rated as noncompensable, and bilateral hearing loss, rated as noncompensable."
1815167P51S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,The Veteran's combined disability rating is 60 percent.
1815167P51S3,,ReasoningSentence,"Thus, the preliminary schedular rating requirements for a TDIU are not met."
1815167P51S4,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(a).
1815167P51S5,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"Therefore, any award of TDIU would have to be on an extraschedular basis."
1815167P51S6,,LegalRuleSentence,It is the policy of VA that all Veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service connected disability shall be rated totally disabled.
1815167P51S7,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(b).
1815167P52S2,LegalRuleSentence,CitationSentence,The process for establishing entitlement to an extraschedular TDIU rating is described in 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(b).
1815167P52S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"That process requires first an adjudicative determination that the Veteran is rendered unemployable by virtue of his service-connected disabilities, and if that determination is affirmative, followed by referral to the Director, Compensation System."
1815167P53S2,,ReasoningSentence,"The central inquiry is ""whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability."""
1815167P53S3,,CitationSentence,"Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993)."
1815167P53S4,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,Neither nonservice-connected disabilities nor advancing age may be considered in the determination.
1815167P53S5,,CitationSentence,"38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.341, 4.19; Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993)."
1815167P54S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,The Veteran is currently retired.
1815167P54S3,,EvidenceSentence,The evidence of record indicates that the Veteran completed high school.
1815167P54S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was last employed as part owner in a family business in April 2008.
1815167P55S2,,EvidenceSentence,"At an April 2009 VA examination, the examiner noted the Veteran functioned quite well in the family business until the death of his brother."
1815167P55S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Thereafter, the Veteran began to have trouble focusing on running the business on a day-to-day basis and getting along with the new co-owner."
1815167P56S2,,EvidenceSentence,The April 2011 examiner opined the Veteran would have difficulty maintaining employment due to his limited ability tolerating noise and crowds.
1815167P57S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The December 2011 addendum opinion concurred the Veteran avoids crowds; however, the report notes that the Veteran is performing ongoing ""handyman"" work."
1815167P58S2,,EvidenceSentence,"At the November 2017 VA examination, the Veteran denied problems interacting with co-workers or being fired from any jobs."
1815167P58S3,,EvidenceSentence,"He reported working with small engine repair on a daily basis and is able to handle all aspects of this, including time demands and frustrating problems, as they arise."
1815167P58S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran indicated that his capacity to deal with challenging events is sufficient.
1815167P58S5,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted the Veteran's capacity to work in confined places is likely limited.
1815167P59S2,,EvidenceSentence,"While acknowledging that the Veteran has some limitations imposed by his service-connected disabilities, and may have not be able to do the job he had done in the past, repeated VA examinations have indicated that he is not precluded from obtaining or maintaining substantially gainful employment."
1815167P59S3,,ReasoningSentence,The Board has assigned these examination reports great probative values as they were based on an examination of the Veteran and a review of the pertinent evidence of record.
1815167P59S4,,EvidenceSentence,"In addition, the examiners addressed the question of employability directly and their opinions are consistent."
1815167P60S2,,FindingSentence,"Accordingly, referral for extraschedular consideration of TDIU pursuant to 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(b), is not warranted and the claim for TDIU is denied."
1815167P61S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"In reaching the above conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine."
1815167P61S3,,FindingSentence,"However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal."
1815167P61S4,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C. Â§ 5107(b) (West 2002); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-56 (1990)."

1815355P42S2,,Sentence,Increased Rating Laws and Regulations
1815355P43S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule of Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability.
1815355P43S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.1.
1815355P43S4,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.
1815355P43S5,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,Disabilities must be reviewed in relation to their history.
1815355P43S6,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.1.
1815355P43S7,,LegalRuleSentence,"Other applicable, general policy considerations are: interpreting reports of examination in light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability, 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.2; resolving any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability in favor of the claimant, 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.3; where there is a questions as to which of two evaluations apply, assigning a higher of the two where the disability pictures more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating, 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.7; and, evaluating functional impairment on the basis of lack of usefulness, and the effects of the disability upon the person's ordinary activity, 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.10."
1815355P43S8,,CitationSentence,"See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991)."
1815355P44S2,,LegalRuleSentence,A claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.
1815355P44S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Thus, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found - a practice known as ""staged"" ratings."
1815355P44S4,,CitationSentence,"Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007)."
1815355P45S2,,Sentence,1.
1815355P45S3,,Sentence,"Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent prior to May 20, 2010 and in excess of 30 percent thereafter for PTSD."
1815355P46S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Considerations in evaluating a mental disorder include the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission."
1815355P46S3,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,The evaluation must be based on all evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment rather than solely on an examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination.
1815355P46S4,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.126(a).
1815355P46S5,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"When determining the appropriate disability evaluation to assign, the Board's ""primary consideration"" is the Veteran's symptoms."
1815355P46S6,,CitationSentence,"See Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 118 (Fed. Cir. 2013)."
1815355P47S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"The Veteran's service-connected PTSD has been rated under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411, which provides, in part as follows:"
1815355P48S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A 30 percent disability rating is warranted when the Veteran experiences occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and normal conversation), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events)."
1815355P49S1,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A 50 percent disability rating is warranted when the Veteran experiences occupational and social impairment, with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g. retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships."
1815355P50S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A 70 percent disability rating is warranted when the Veteran experiences occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most area, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure or irrelevant; near- continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or work like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships."
1815355P51S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A 100 percent disability rating is warranted for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of closest relatives, own occupation, or own name."
1815355P51S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130.
1815355P52S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181 (1998), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that VA regulations require that when the symptoms and/or degree of impairment due to a Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disability cannot be distinguished from any other diagnosed psychiatric disorders, VA must consider all psychiatric symptoms in the adjudication of the claim."
1815355P53S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's PTSD was rated at 30 percent disabling.
1815355P53S3,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"To receive a higher disability rating during that period, the evidence must show occupational and social impairment, with reduced reliability and productivity."

1815355P56S2,,FindingSentence,The Board finds that a preponderance of the evidence shows that the Veteran's PTSD did not manifest to the level of a 50 percent disability rating.
1815355P56S3,,EvidenceSentence,The VA examiner in July 2010 specifically noted that the Veteran's PTSD signs and symptoms were transient or mild and decreased work efficiency and the ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress.
1815355P56S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The VA examiner in August 2016 found occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care, and conversation."
1815355P56S5,,EvidenceSentence,The evidence indicates that the Veteran's symptoms were mild in degree.
1815355P57S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Specifically, the Veteran did not have a flattened affect, circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech, panic attacks more than once a week, difficulty in understanding complex commands, impairment of short- and long-term memory, impaired judgment, impaired abstract thinking, disturbances of motivation and mood, or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships."
1815355P58S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"The Board has considered that the symptoms listed in Diagnostic Code 9411 are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating."
1815355P58S3,,CitationSentence,"See Vazquez-Claudio; see also Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002)."
1815355P58S4,,ReasoningSentence,"As such, the Board notes that the Veteran experiences other symptoms that are not listed in the criteria, but may reflect the severity of his PTSD."
1815355P58S5,,EvidenceSentence,"These include, but are not limited to recurrent and intrusive distressing recollections, persistent avoidance, difficulty falling or staying asleep, and difficulty concentrating."
1815355P58S6,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Specifically, the Board has also considered many of the Veteran's symptoms as ""like or similar to"" the schedular rating criteria of occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, or suspiciousness."
1815355P58S7,,CitationSentence,"See Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. 436."
1815355P59S2,,FindingSentence,"Based on the evidence of record, and after resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the manifestations of the Veteran's PTSD do not more nearly approximate the criteria for a 50 percent disability rating."
1815355P59S3,,FindingSentence,"As such, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim."
1815355P60S2,,Sentence,2.
1815355P60S3,Sentence,EvidenceSentence,"Entitlement to a compensable disability rating prior to April 15, 2016 and in excess of 60 percent thereafter for CAD."
1815355P61S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's representative has submitted a notice of disagreement with the effective date of the April 15, 2016 assignment of a 60 percent disability rating."
1815355P61S3,,ReasoningSentence,"The Board notes that the issue of entitlement to a higher disability rating for CAD prior and subsequent to the April 15, 2016 assignment is currently on appeal."
1815355P61S4,FindingSentence,ReasoningSentence,"As this appeal addresses the entitlement to a higher disability rating prior to April 15, 2016, the Board finds that the issue is already on appeal and a separate issue regarding the effective date of the April 15, 2016 increased rating is moot."
1815355P61S5,,Sentence,Thus the staged rating will be addressed below.
1815355P62S2,,ReasoningSentence,The Board also notes that the Veteran's CAD has been rated at times with and at times without subtracting the level of disability present prior to aggravation by the Veteran's diabetes mellitus.
1815355P62S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"When rating based upon aggravation, the Veteran is entitled to a compensable rating only for the increase in severity of the symptoms caused by the aggravating factor."
1815355P62S4,,ReasoningSentence,"In this case, the Board notes that the Veteran served in Vietnam."
1815355P62S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"Under 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1116(a)(2) and 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.309(e), as to Veterans who served in Vietnam during a certain time period, selected diseases may be presumed to have resulted from exposure to herbicide agents such as Agent Orange."
1815355P62S6,,EvidenceSentence,"According to the Veteran's service records, he served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam Era, therefore, his exposure to toxic herbicides is presumed."
1815355P62S7,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1116, 1154."
1815355P63S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Regulations provide, in pertinent part, that if a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent (such as Agent Orange) during active military, naval, or air service, the following diseases shall be service-connected if the requirements of 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.307(a)(6) are met even though there is no record of such disease during service, provided further that the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.307(d) are also satisfied: AL amyloidosis, chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne, type 2 diabetes (also known as Type II diabetes mellitus or adult-onset diabetes), Hodgkin's disease, ischemic heart disease (including, but not limited to, acute, subacute, and old myocardial infarction; atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease (including coronary spasm) and coronary bypass surgery; and stable, unstable and Prinzmetal's angina), all chronic B-cell leukemias (including, but not limited to, hairy-cell leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia), multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Parkinson's disease, early-onset peripheral neuropathy, porphyria cutanea tarda, prostate cancer, respiratory cancers (cancer of the lung, bronchus, larynx, or trachea), and soft-tissue sarcoma (other than osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, or mesothelioma)."
1815355P63S3,,CitationSentence,I 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.309(e).
1815355P64S2,ReasoningSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"Although the Veteran's CAD was originally granted on the basis of aggravation, due to the inconsistent application of the rating criteria for aggravation and the Veteran's service in Vietnam, which would have allowed direct service connection, the Board will rate the Veteran's CAD on a direct basis without consideration of aggravation of the disability by the diabetes mellitus."
1815355P65S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,The Veteran's CAD is rated under the Diagnostic Code 7005 for arteriosclerotic heart disease.
1815355P65S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Under that regulation, CAD resulting in chronic congestive heart failure, or; workload of 3 METs or less results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent warrants a 100 percent disability rating."
1815355P65S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"CAD with more  than one episode of acute congestive heart failure in the past year, or; workload of greater than 3 METs but not greater than 5 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 30 to 50 percent warrants a 60 percent disability rating."
1815355P65S5,,LegalRuleSentence,"CAD with a workload of greater than 5 METs but not greater than 7 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray warrants a 30 percent disability rating."
1815355P65S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"CAD with a workload of greater than 7 METs but not greater than 10 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; continuous medication required warrants a 10 percent disability rating."
1815355P65S7,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.104.
1815355P66S2,,ReasoningSentence,"Prior to April 15, 2016, the Veteran's CAD is rated as noncompensable."
1815355P66S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"To receive a higher disability rating during that time period, the evidence must show a workload of greater than 7 METs but not greater than 10 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or continuous medication required."
1815355P67S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran attended a VA examination in June 2010.
1815355P67S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran performed a stress test.
1815355P67S4,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"The Veteran exercised for 7:07 minutes, achieving a work level of 8:70 METS."
1815355P67S5,,EvidenceSentence,The maximal heart rate was 137 beats per minute (88 percent of maximal age-predicted heart rate).
1815355P67S6,,EvidenceSentence,The exercise test was stopped due to fatigue and target heart rate.
1815355P67S7,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,Ejection fraction was 35 to 45 percent.
1815355P68S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in August 2010.
1815355P68S3,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted that the Veteran's ejection fraction decreased from 50 percent in 2007 to 35-45 percent in 2008.
1815355P68S4,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted a new stenosis requiring a stent.
1815355P69S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,The Board notes that the evidence showed an ejection fraction of 30 to 50 percent.
1815355P69S3,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, a 60 percent disability rating is warranted throughout the period on appeal."
1815355P70S2,,LegalRuleSentence,The Board must then determine whether a disability rating in excess of 60 percent is warranted throughout the entire period on appeal.
1815355P70S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"To receive a higher disability rating, the evidence must show chronic congestive heart failure, or; workload of 3 METs or less results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent."
1815355P71S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in April 2016.
1815355P71S3,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner diagnosed CAD.
1815355P71S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran had angioplasty, coronary artery bypass surgery, and an implanted cardiac pacemaker."
1815355P71S5,,EvidenceSentence,Physical examination showed regular rhythm with a heart rate of 62.
1815355P71S6,,EvidenceSentence,The point of maximal impact was not palpable.
1815355P71S7,,EvidenceSentence,The heart sounds were normal and auscultation of the lungs was clear.
1815355P71S8,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran did not have jugular-venous distension.
1815355P71S9,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted no lower extremity peripheral edema.
1815355P71S10,,EvidenceSentence,His blood pressure was 135/78.
1815355P71S11,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran had an interview-based METs test.
1815355P71S12,,EvidenceSentence,"The METs level was >3-5, consistent with activities such as light yard work, mowing lawn, and brisk walking."
1815355P71S13,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted dyspnea and fatigue.
1815355P72S2,,EvidenceSentence,The evidence shows that the Veteran did not have chronic congestive heart failure.
1815355P72S3,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,Examination revealed METs greater than 3.
1815355P72S4,,EvidenceSentence,The record did not show ejection fraction of less than 30 percent.
1815355P72S5,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, the Board finds that a disability rating in excess of 60 percent is not warranted from April 15, 2016 forward."
1815355P73S2,,FindingSentence,"Based on the evidence of record, and after resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the manifestations of the Veteran's CAD met the criteria for a 60 percent disability rating, but no greater, throughout the entire period on appeal."
1815355P73S3,FindingSentence,Sentence,"To that extent, the Veteran's claim is granted."
1815355P74S2,,Sentence,3-4.
1815355P74S3,,Sentence,Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for peripheral neuropathy of the right and left upper extremities.
1815355P75S2,,Sentence,
1815355P76S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,The Board will address the claims for increased ratings for peripheral neuropathy of the right and left upper extremities together as they stem from the same factual background.
1815355P77S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,The Veteran's right and left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy is rated at 20 percent each under Diagnostic Code 8521 for paralysis of the external popliteal nerve.
1815355P77S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Under that regulation, complete paralysis of the nerve with foot drop and slight droop of first phalanges of all toes, cannot dorsiflex the foot, extension (dorsal flexion) of proximal phalanges of toes lost; abduction of foot lost, adduction weakened; anesthesia covers entire dorsum of foot and toes, warrants a 40 percent disability rating."

1815355P77S7,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.124a.
1815355P78S2,,EvidenceSentence,"During the June 2010 VA examination for diabetes mellitus, the examiner diagnosed bilateral upper extremity neuropathy."
1815355P78S3,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,Testing showed electrophysiological findings indicative of a moderate diffuse sensorimotor polyneuropathy.
1815355P79S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran attended a VA examination in July 2012.
1815355P79S3,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner diagnosed diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
1815355P79S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was left hand dominant.
1815355P79S5,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted mild bilateral upper extremity numbness.
1815355P79S6,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran had normal strength for the upper extremities with no muscle atrophy.
1815355P79S7,,EvidenceSentence,Reflex examination was normal.
1815355P79S8,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,The sensory examination showed decreased results for sensation testing for light touch of the hands and fingers.

1815355P80S7,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran had no muscle atrophy or trophic changes.
1815355P80S8,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted mild bilateral incomplete paralysis of the median nerve.
1815355P81S2,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"To receive a higher disability rating, the evidence must show severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve."

1815355P81S4,,EvidenceSentence,At no point did the treatment records or VA examinations show severe peripheral neuropathy of the right or left upper extremity.
1815355P82S2,,FindingSentence,"Based on the evidence of record, and after resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the manifestations of the Veteran's right or left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy do not more nearly approximate the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for either extremity."
1815355P82S3,,FindingSentence,"As such, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claims."

1815355P84S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,The Veteran's diabetes mellitus is rated at 20 percent under Diagnostic Code 7913.
1815355P84S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Diagnostic Code 7913 provides, in part as follows:"
1815355P85S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Diabetes mellitus requiring more than one daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities (avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities) with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring at least three hospitalizations per year or weekly visits to a diabetic care provider, plus either progressive loss of weight and strength or complications that would be compensable if separately evaluated, warrants a 100 percent disability rating."
1815355P86S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Diabetes mellitus requiring one or more daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring one or two hospitalizations per year or twice a month visits to a diabetic care provider, plus complications that would not be compensable if separately evaluated, warrants a 60 percent disability rating."
1815355P87S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Diabetes mellitus requiring one or more daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities warrants a 40 percent disability rating."
1815355P88S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"Diabetes mellitus requiring one or more daily injection of insulin and restricted diet, or; oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet warrants a 20 percent disability rating."

1815355P92S3,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,The Veteran's diabetes mellitus is managed with restricted diet and prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents.
1815355P92S4,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Therefore, the Veteran's symptoms do not more nearly approximate the criteria for a higher disability rating."
1815355P93S2,,LegalRuleSentence,The Board notes that Diagnostic Code 7913 Note (1) indicates that compensable complications of diabetes should be evaluated separately unless they are part of the criteria used to support a 100 percent evaluation.
1815355P93S3,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,Noncompensable complications are considered part of the diabetic process under Diagnostic Code 7913.
1815355P93S4,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.119.
1815355P94S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,Retinopathy is rated under Diagnostic Code 6006.
1815355P94S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"To receive a separate compensable rating for retinopathy under that regulation, the evidence must show incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least one week, but less than two weeks, during the prior 12 months, or vision correctable to a minimum of 20/40 in one eye and 20/50 in another eye."

1815355P95S7,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted no incapacitating episodes attributable to any eye conditions.
1815355P95S8,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, the  Board finds that a separate compensable disability rating is not warranted for diabetic retinopathy."
1815355P96S2,,FindingSentence,"Based on the evidence of record, and after resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the manifestations of the Veteran's diabetes mellitus with diabetic retinopathy do not more nearly approximate the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 20 percent."
1815355P96S3,,FindingSentence,"As such, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim."
1815355P97S2,,Sentence,6.
1815355P97S3,,Sentence,Entitlement to TDIU.
1815355P98S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Board notes that the Veteran has requested unemployability due to his service-connected disabilities.
1815355P98S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Where a Veteran: (1) submits evidence of a medical disability; (2) makes a claim for the highest rating possible; and (3) submits evidence of unemployability, the requirement in 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.155(a) that an informal claim ""identify the benefit sought"" has been satisfied and VA must consider whether the Veteran is entitled to a total rating for compensation purposes based on individual unemployability (TDIU)."
1815355P98S4,,CitationSentence,"See Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (VA to ""determine all potential claims raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations""); See also Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009) (holding that an appeal for higher rating includes a claim for TDIU, if reasonably raised by the record)."
1815355P99S2,,ReasoningSentence,"In light of the Court's determination that evidence of unemployability in the context of a rating claim may include a TDIU claim as well as the submission of vocational evaluations, the Board finds that the issue of TDIU is currently on appeal as part of his increased rating claims."
1815355P99S3,FindingSentence,Sentence,"Therefore, the Board may address the issue without remanding it for the agency of original jurisdiction to address it in the first instance."
1815355P100S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity."
1815355P100S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1155 (West 2014).
1815355P100S4,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,Total disability is considered to exist when there is any impairment which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.
1815355P100S5,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,Total disability may or may not be permanent.
1815355P100S6,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.340(a)(1).
1815355P100S7,,LegalRuleSentence,Total ratings are authorized for any disability or combination of disabilities for which the Rating Schedule prescribes a 100 percent evaluation.
1815355P100S8,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.340(a)(2).
1815355P101S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"TDIU may be assigned when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities."
1815355P101S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"If there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, with sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more."
1815355P101S4,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(a).
1815355P102S1,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"But for the above purpose of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) disabilities of one or both upper extremities, or of one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable, (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident, (3) disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g. orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric, (4) multiple injuries incurred in action, or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war."
1815355P102S2,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(a).

1815355P103S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor."
1815355P103S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.3.
1815355P104S2,,LegalRuleSentence,All veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled.
1815355P104S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(b) (2011).
1815355P104S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"Factors such as employment history, as well as educational and vocational attainments, should be considered."
1815355P104S5,,CitationSentence,Id.
1815355P104S6,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"For VA purposes, the term unemployability is synonymous with an inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation."
1815355P104S7,,CitationSentence,VAOPGCPREC 75-91; 57 Fed. Reg. 2317 (1992).
1815355P104S8,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,"The word substantially suggests intent to impart flexibility into a determination of a veteran's overall employability, as opposed to requiring the appellant to prove that he is 100 percent unemployable."
1815355P104S9,,CitationSentence,"Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001)."
1815355P105S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In this case, the Veteran contends that he is unable to secure employment due to his service-connected disabilities."
1815355P105S3,,FindingSentence,"The Veteran is service connected for CAD at 60 percent, PTSD at 30 percent, diabetes mellitus with diabetic retinopathy at 20 percent, peripheral neuropathy of the right lower extremity at 20 percent, peripheral neuropathy of the left lower extremity at 20 percent, peripheral neuropathy of the right upper extremity at 10 percent, peripheral neuropathy of the left upper extremity at 10 percent, tinnitus at 10 percent, atrial fibrillation at 10 percent, and residual scar at 0 percent."
1815355P105S4,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,He currently has a total disability rating of 90 percent.
1815355P105S5,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, the percentage criteria for TDIU are met throughout the period on appeal and entitlement to TDIU is considered on a schedular basis."
1815355P105S6,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.16(a).
1815355P106S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In October 2017, a vocational consultant reviewed the Veteran's records and provided an opinion regarding his ability to obtain and maintain employment."
1815355P106S3,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner specified the Veteran's service-connected disabilities.
1815355P106S4,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner cited multiple medical records from the Veteran's files.
1815355P106S5,,EvidenceSentence,The consultant cited studies and research regarding the ability of the Veteran to maintain employment.
1815355P106S6,,EvidenceSentence,"The consultant found that the Veteran would be expected to miss more than one day per month based on the reports of his physical and mental symptoms, the results of the evaluations, and his prior work history."
1815355P106S7,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,More than five percent of time off-task for any reason would prevent sustaining competitive work.
1815355P106S8,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran would likely exceed that due to emotional and physical symptoms impacting his concentration and persistence at a work task.
1815355P106S9,,EvidenceSentence,The consultant also noted that the Veteran had a combination of physical and emotional conditions that interact in terms of severity level.
1815355P106S10,,EvidenceSentence,"The consultant noted the opinion that found that his diabetes, heart condition, and peripheral neuropathy would not impact his ability to work."
1815355P106S11,,EvidenceSentence,"Another doctor, however, opined that the Veteran could not be a driver due to his eye disability."
1815355P106S12,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran had fatigue, chest pain, and shortness of breath, and due to his service-connected disabilities, he would be unable to maintain substantially gainful employment."
1815355P106S13,,EvidenceSentence,"The consultant found that due to the combination of the Veteran's fatigue, deficiencies in focus and concentration, and his inability to attend work in a predictable manner, the Veteran would not be able to sustain any level of work activity."
1815355P107S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Board recognizes that the opinions of the VA examiners when considering the disabilities individually found that each individual disability did not prevent the Veteran from obtaining or maintaining substantially gainful employment.
1815355P107S3,,EvidenceSentence,The VA examiners did not provide an opinion that considered the Veteran's mental and physical disabilities in combination.
1815355P107S4,EvidenceSentence,ReasoningSentence,The private VA consultant reviewed the record and provided an opinion that cited studies as well as the Veteran's treatment records and VA examinations.
1815355P108S2,LegalRuleSentence,ReasoningSentence,The Board notes that all doubt is to be resolved in the Veteran's favor.
1815355P108S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5107(b); also see generally Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App 49 (1990); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001)."

1815439P13S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran served on active duty from June 1969 to June 1972.

1815439P21S2,,Sentence,I. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000
1815439P22S2,FindingSentence,Sentence,"With respect to the Veteran's claim herein, VA has met all statutory and regulatory notice and duty to assist provisions."
1815439P22S3,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326; see also Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015)."
1815439P23S2,,Sentence,II.
1815439P23S3,,Sentence,Acquired Psychiatric Disorder
1815439P24S2,EvidenceSentence,FindingSentence,"The Veteran contends that service connection is warranted for PTSD, based on several non-combat-related stressors: the Veteran's presence during riots in Okinawa, Japan; a ""race riot"" in Portsmouth, Virginia; and, a typhoon while being transported in Southeast Asia."
1815439P25S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Service connection for PTSD requires (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125(a) (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (4th ed.) (2015) (DSM-IV)); (2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred."
1815439P25S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f).
1815439P25S4,LegalRuleSentence,FindingSentence,Diagnoses of PTSD are presumed to have been made in accordance with the DSM-IV criteria.
1815439P25S5,,CitationSentence,"Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 139-42 (1997)."
1815439P26S2,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"(The DSM-IV has been updated with a Fifth Edition (DSM-V), and VA has amended Â§ 4.125(a) to reflect this update."
1815439P26S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"However, the amendment only applies to applications that are received by VA or are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after August 4, 2014, and does not apply to appeals already certified to the Board or pending before the Board."
1815439P26S4,,CitationSentence,79 Fed. Reg. 45093.)
1815439P27S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"In adjudicating a claim for service connection for PTSD, the Board is required to evaluate evidence based on places, types, and circumstances of service, as shown by the Veteran's military records and all pertinent medical and lay evidence."
1815439P27S3,,CitationSentence,"Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 66 (1993); see also 38 U.S.C. Â§ 1154(a); 38 C.F.R."
1815439P28S2,,CitationSentence,Â§ 3.304(f).
1815439P28S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"The evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of an in-service stressor for PTSD will vary depending on whether or not the Veteran ""engaged in combat with the enemy."""
1815439P28S4,,CitationSentence,Id.
1815439P29S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"If VA determines that the Veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy or that the alleged stressor is not related to combat, the Veteran's lay testimony by itself is not sufficient to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor."
1815439P29S3,,LegalRuleSentence,"Instead, the record must contain service records or other evidence to corroborate the Veteran's testimony or statements."
1815439P29S4,,CitationSentence,"See Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 394 (1996)."
1815439P30S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"The question of whether a Veteran was exposed to a stressor in service is a factual one, and VA adjudicators are not bound to accept uncorroborated accounts of stressors or medical opinions based upon such accounts."
1815439P30S3,,CitationSentence,"Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991), aff'd on reconsideration, 1 Vet. App. 406 (1991)."
1815439P30S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"Hence, whether a stressor was of sufficient gravity to cause or support a diagnosis of PTSD is a question of fact for medical professionals and whether the evidence establishes the occurrence of stressors is a question of fact for adjudicators."
1815439P31S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"If a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor."
1815439P32S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"For purposes of this paragraph, ""fear of hostile military or terrorist activity"" means that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the Veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the Veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror."
1815439P32S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f)(3).
1815439P33S2,,FindingSentence,The evidence of record establishes that the Veteran has current diagnoses that meet DSM-IV criteria for chronic PTSD.
1815439P33S3,,CitationSentence,See April 2011 VA Examination.
1815439P34S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Board also notes that the Veteran was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety in June 2009, as well as recurrent Major Depressive Disorder and PTSD in April 2017."
1815439P35S2,EvidenceSentence,LegalRuleSentence,"Turning to whether there is a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor, an April 2011 VA examiner indicated that only the typhoon incident met DSM-IV criteria for a traumatic stressor."
1815439P35S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's PTSD was caused by or a result of the Veteran's military service (i.e., the typhoon he experienced)."
1815439P35S4,,EvidenceSentence,"However, the examiner also opined that the Veteran's claimed stressor was not related to his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity."
1815439P36S2,,FindingSentence,"Nevertheless, the Board finds that the claimed stressor, i.e., the typhoon incident, is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service."
1815439P37S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Board notes that the Veteran submitted evidence purporting to document that he encountered a typhoon during service.
1815439P37S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran submitted the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships from the Department of Navy, Naval Historical Center, which records the chronology and significant events of the USS Duluth (LPD-6)."
1815439P37S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's military personnel records indicate that he embarked on the Duluth in May 1970.
1815439P37S5,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"According to the dictionary, the Duluth encountered one typhoon, Typhoon Jane, in October 1970."
1815439P38S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's military personnel records indicate that he departed onboard the Duluth at White Beach in Okinawa in June 1970 and disembarked the ship at U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay on June 1970.
1815439P38S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Although these records do not confirm that he encountered Typhoon Jane in October 1970, they do indicate that he remained in Okinawa."
1815439P38S4,,EvidenceSentence,"For example, in January 1971 the Veteran disembarked the USS Tom Green County at Kin Red Beach, Okinawa (LST 1159)."
1815439P38S5,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"In addition, as a Marine in the Reconnaissance Battalion, it is consistent with the circumstances of his service that he was onboard ships at rates that were not documented by his service records."
1815439P39S2,,FindingSentence,"Based on a review of the evidence, the Board concludes that service connection for PTSD is warranted."
1815439P39S3,,EvidenceSentence,The April 2011 examiner opined that it was at least as likely as not that PTSD was caused by or a result of the typhoon incident.
1815439P39S4,,FindingSentence,"The Board concedes an in-service stressor of a fear of hostile military activity, as such is consistent with the Veteran's military service."
1815439P39S5,,FindingSentence,"When affording the Veteran the benefit-of-the-doubt, the Board finds that the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran's PTSD is related to his military service."
1815439P39S6,,FindingSentence,"Thus, service connection for PTSD is granted."
1815439P40S1,,Sentence,ORDER
1815439P41S2,,Sentence,Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.

1815740P15S1,,Sentence,INTRODUCTION
1815740P16S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran had active service from February to August 2001 and from March 2004 to October 2005.
1815740P17S2,,Sentence,"This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Paul, Minnesota."
1815740P18S1,,LegalRuleSentence,The issues of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea and entitlement to a TDIU are REMANDED to the AOJ.  VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.
1815740P19S1,,Sentence,FINDING OF FACT
1815740P20S2,,ReasoningSentence,"The Veteran's service-connected PTSD is manifested by no more than occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to various symptoms; the symptoms do not result in both total occupational and social impairment."
1815740P21S1,,Sentence,CONCLUSION OF LAW
1815740P22S2,,FindingSentence,The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD have not been met.
1815740P22S3,,CitationSentence,"38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1155, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.21, 4.125, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411 (2017)."
1815740P23S1,,Sentence,REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION
1815740P24S2,,LegalRuleSentence,Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability.
1815740P24S3,,CitationSentence,38 U.S.C. Â§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.1.
1815740P25S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"If the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating will be assigned; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned."
1815740P25S3,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.7.
1815740P25S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances."
1815740P25S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.21.
1815740P26S2,ReasoningSentence,Sentence,"In deciding this appeal, the Board has considered whether separate ratings for different periods of time, based on the facts found, are warranted, a practice of assigning ratings referred to as ""staging the ratings."""
1815740P26S3,,CitationSentence,"See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999)."
1815740P27S2,LegalRuleSentence,Sentence,"When evaluating a mental disorder, the rating agency shall consider the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission."
1815740P27S3,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,The rating agency shall assign an evaluation based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination.
1815740P27S4,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"When evaluating the level of disability from a mental disorder, the rating agency will consider the extent of social impairment, but shall not assign an evaluation solely on the basis of social impairment."
1815740P27S5,,CitationSentence,38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.126.
1815740P28S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has explained that the list of symptoms under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130 is a nonexhaustive list, as indicated by the words ""such as"" that precede each list of symptoms."
1815740P28S3,,CitationSentence,"Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 115 (Fed. Cir. 2013)."
1815740P28S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"In Vazquez-Claudio, the Federal Circuit held that a veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.130 by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration."
1815740P28S5,,CitationSentence,Id. at 118.
1815740P28S6,,LegalRuleSentence,"Other language in the decision indicates that the phrase ""others of similar severity, frequency, and duration,"" can be thought of as symptoms of like kind to those listed in the regulation for a given disability rating."
1815740P28S7,,CitationSentence,Id. at 116.
1815740P29S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, an evaluation of 70 percent for PTSD will be assigned where there is evidence of occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships."
1815740P29S3,,CitationSentence,Id.
1815740P30S2,LegalRuleSentence,EvidenceSentence,"A 100 percent rating is assigned when there is total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name."
1815740P30S3,,CitationSentence,Id.
1815740P31S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"When it is not possible to separate the effects of a non-service-connected condition from those of a service-connected disorder, reasonable doubt should be resolved in the claimant's favor with regard to the question of whether certain signs and symptoms can be attributed to the service-connected disability."
1815740P31S3,,CitationSentence,"See Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181, 182 (1998)."
1815740P32S2,,Sentence,III.Analysis
1815740P33S2,,FindingSentence,"In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations set forth above, the Board concludes that the Veteran is not entitled to a disability rating in excess of 70 percent for his PTSD for any part of the period on appeal and finds that, in this case, the clinical evidence more closely reflects the criteria for the 70 percent rating."
1815740P33S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's PTSD symptoms include ongoing depressed mood, anxiety, occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, anxiety, social isolation, occasional suicidal ideation, and chronic sleep impairment."
1815740P34S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran was granted service connection for PTSD in November 2010 and granted a 30 percent disability rating, effective December 16, 2009."
1815740P34S3,,Sentence,The Veteran submitted a claim requesting an increase in September 2011.
1815740P34S4,,CitationSentence,"See VA 21-526b, Veteran Supplemental Claim."
1815740P34S5,,EvidenceSentence,"In December 2012, the RO increased the Veteran's initial disability rating from 30 percent to 50 percent, with an effective date of December 16, 2009."
1815740P34S6,,EvidenceSentence,"In February 2013, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940, Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, due to his PTSD."
1815740P34S7,,EvidenceSentence,"In November 2013, the RO denied TDIU, but increased the Veteran's PTSD disability rating from 50 percent to 70 percent, effective February 27, 2013."
1815740P35S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in June 2013 for his PTSD.
1815740P35S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner reviewed the Veteran's claim file and stated that the Veteran's occupational and social impairment was best summarized as ""occupational and social impairment with occasional decreased in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation."""
1815740P35S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner also stated that the Veteran had ongoing issues with mental health PTSD, anxiety and depression, which are more likely associated with behavior health issues such as memory/attention problems."
1815740P35S5,,EvidenceSentence,"On examination, the Veteran's symptoms included depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work-like setting, and neglect of personal appearance and hygiene."
1815740P35S6,,EvidenceSentence,"For example, the examiner reported that the Veteran presented rather poorly groomed (i.e., long, oily hair) in casual dress."
1815740P35S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's affect was stable and relaxed but described his typical mood as ""nervous, easy-going sometimes,"" depending on where he is, stating that when he goes out, he is withdrawn."
1815740P36S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was then afforded an examination in November 2014 by a private treatment provider.
1815740P36S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner noted that the Veteran's psychosocial and environmental problems included unemployment, financial difficulties, and problems with his primary support group."
1815740P36S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner summarized his occupational and social impairment as ""occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood."""
1815740P36S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran's symptoms were documented as depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events, flattened affect, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work-like setting, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, suicidal ideation, persistent delusions or hallucinations, neglect of personal appearance and hygiene, and intermittent ability to perform activities of daily living, including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene."
1815740P37S2,,EvidenceSentence,"This examiner reported that the Veteran stated he could ""no longer enjoy the simplest of activities."""
1815740P37S3,,EvidenceSentence,The examination report reflected that the Veteran's attention was normal and concentration appeared variable.
1815740P37S4,,EvidenceSentence,He complained of increased trouble with short- and long-term memory and struggled with remembering basic information.
1815740P37S5,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran reported of overt hallucinations.
1815740P37S6,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran's mood was anxious and nervous and his affect was restricted.
1815740P37S7,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran did report feeling anxious and depressed and endorsed symptomatology of PTSD, as even with the examiner he appeared suspicious and vigilant."
1815740P38S2,,EvidenceSentence,A medical opinion for the Veteran's ability to perform work-related activities was completed by the examiner.
1815740P38S3,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner found that the Veteran missed 3 or more days per month because of mental problems.
1815740P38S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran needed to leave early from the workplace 3 or more days per month because of mental problems.
1815740P38S5,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,"For more than 3 days per month, the Veteran would not stay focused for at least 7 hours of an 8 hour workday."
1815740P38S6,,EvidenceSentence,"More than once per month, the Veteran would respond in an angry manner but would not actually become violent when subjected to the normal pressures and constructive criticisms of a job."
1815740P39S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In May 2015, the Veteran was again afforded a VA examination by a psychologist who reviewed the Veteran's claims file and conducted an in-person interview of the Veteran."
1815740P39S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner noted that the Veteran had 3 diagnoses - alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, and PTSD."
1815740P39S4,,EvidenceSentence,"When asked if it was possible to differentiate which symptoms are attributable to each diagnosis, the examiner stated that the Veteran's substance abuse is too pervasive and his self-report was non-credible."
1815740P39S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner summarized the Veteran's level of occupational and social impairment with regards to all mental diagnoses as ""occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity."""
1815740P39S6,,EvidenceSentence,"In this regard, the examiner stated that the ""Veteran's current impairment is secondary to substance abuse and disengagement in appropriate mental health treatment."""
1815740P39S7,,EvidenceSentence,"At the time of examination, the Veteran reported working 12 hours per week as a gardener for a country club, but stated that he did not like it, did not like sitting in traffic, and felt ""like a servant there."""
1815740P40S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner documented his observations of the Veteran's behavior as alert and oriented, with appropriate grooming and dress."
1815740P40S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran had good eye contact and was in no apparent pain or distress.
1815740P40S4,,EvidenceSentence,"He described his mood as ""down"" but could not articulate why, stating ""just life in general"" as the reason for his mood."
1815740P40S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran endorsed chronic symptoms of depression including: low mood, hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, anhedonia, and isolation."
1815740P40S6,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran claimed to have chronic anxiety and panic attacks weekly, lasting 45 minutes."
1815740P40S7,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran also claimed to have adequate memory except for people's names.
1815740P40S8,,EvidenceSentence,"He stated that he did not know the name of his boss, coworkers, or the names of the plants he works with."
1815740P40S9,,EvidenceSentence,He reported some suicidal ideation but denied homicidal ideation or psychosis.
1815740P41S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Despite these reports, the examiner found that ""the profile is invalid for interpretation due to a non-credible pattern of responses."
1815740P41S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran end[o]rsed a large number of deviant psychiatric symptoms that are not even claimed among severely ill psychiatric inpatients.
1815740P41S4,,EvidenceSentence,"Similarly, he endorsed a non-credible pattern of somatic and cognitive symptoms that are not reported among individuals with bona fide health disease or cognitive disorders."
1815740P41S5,EvidenceSentence,ReasoningSentence,"Overall, the profile pattern is consistent with individuals who exaggerate or malinger psychiatric, health, and somatic symptoms."""
1815740P41S6,EvidenceSentence,ReasoningSentence,"In his opinion, it is unlikely that the Veteran is experiencing functional impairments with the degree of severity claimed."
1815740P41S7,,EvidenceSentence,"In his rationale, the examiner stated that the Veteran's alcohol and cannabis use are most likely the primary cause for impairments and probably some symptoms as well."
1815740P42S2,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran was again afforded a VA examination in September 2016.
1815740P42S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner was unable to access the Veteran's electronic claims file, but reviewed previous VA examination reports and medical records available for treatment from the time following the last VA examination and current providers."
1815740P43S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran was assessed with PTSD, but no other mental health diagnosis was given."
1815740P43S3,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner stated that the Veteran's PTSD included anxiety, poor concentration, irritability, intrusive thoughts and nightmares, depressed mood, and hypervigilance."
1815740P43S4,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner noted a history of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) but the symptoms overlapped with concentration and memory issues associated with PTSD, anxiety, and depression."
1815740P43S5,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner summarized the Veteran's level of occupational and social impairment as ""occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood."""
1815740P43S6,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran reported that he does not feel that he is capable of working because he does not know how to manage his frustration and agitation when dealing with people.
1815740P43S7,,EvidenceSentence,He reported being uncomfortable in areas that people are around and he has difficulty keeping track of all the things he has to do.
1815740P44S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The Veteran was not working at the time of the examination, but worked seasonally at a greenhouse for approximately 15 hours a week."
1815740P44S3,,EvidenceSentence,"He was seen by a psychiatrist every 6 months, though he reported disliking driving in traffic and had no health insurance so he did not seek mental health treatment other than medications."
1815740P44S4,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner conducted the PTSD diagnostic criteria.
1815740P44S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Under criterion B, the Veteran reported having dreams of being back in the Army, where they will not allow him to leave and there are fire fights and motor attacks going on around him."
1815740P44S6,,EvidenceSentence,He also stated getting angry; his heart rate increases and he experiences shortness of breath.
1815740P44S7,,EvidenceSentence,He stated these were often triggered by loud noises and helicopters.
1815740P44S8,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran used to gun hunt but now only hunts with a bow and arrows and does not go out when gun-hunting season begins.
1815740P44S9,,EvidenceSentence,"Under criterion C, the Veteran reported he did not like being in crowds where he cannot keep track of everything going on around him."
1815740P44S10,,EvidenceSentence,He does not like to go to the area where he was in the National Guard and he avoids talking to anyone from his unit.
1815740P44S11,,EvidenceSentence,"Under criterion E, the Veteran reported drinking too much, though he did not drink and drive."
1815740P45S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Symptoms of PTSD included depressed mood (helped by medication but experienced depression at least a few times per week); anxiety (the Veteran described feeling ""okay"" at home but experiencing anxiety when he left the house); chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events - focus and concentration problems); flattened affect; difficulty in understanding complex commands/hard to follow verbal commands; impaired judgment (the Veteran sometimes abuses alcohol; he ""flies off the handle"" easily; he feels he made poor decisions concerning college; he had a fantasy that with his knowledge of horticulture he would be able to go away and live off the land somewhere growing his own food and living with just his family."
1815740P45S3,,EvidenceSentence,"He realizes this is an unrealistic plan now and feels he has wasted his 4 years of college on a degree he cannot do anything with); disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work-like setting; suicidal ideation (he has thoughts of killing himself by drinking and self-destruction and reckless behavior); obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; grossly inappropriate behavior (the Veteran reports not having a filter and says things that are hurtful to others, even when he does not mean to); feelings of hopelessness; feelings of guilt or worthlessness."
1815740P45S4,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner stated that there were no other symptoms attributable to PTSD not listed.
1815740P46S2,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner documented the Veteran's mental status and behavioral observations.
1815740P46S3,,EvidenceSentence,He noted that the Veteran appeared alert and oriented.
1815740P46S4,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran described his general mood as somewhat agitated when going through security at the medical center and he was anxious but pleasant during the interview.
1815740P46S5,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran described having trouble falling and staying asleep.
1815740P46S6,EvidenceSentence,Sentence,His concentration is poor.
1815740P46S7,,EvidenceSentence,He denied manic/hypomanic episodes and phobic avoidances.
1815740P46S8,,EvidenceSentence,He described a number of hypervigilant behaviors and reported that he tended to startle easily as well.
1815740P47S2,ReasoningSentence,FindingSentence,Post-service treatment records show that the Veteran has consistently and continuously been treated for PTSD following service.
1815740P48S2,,ReasoningSentence,"There is no question that the Veteran's psychiatric disability is productive of a high degree of impairment, as reflected by the 70 percent evaluation currently in effect."
1815740P48S3,,EvidenceSentence,"However, the Veteran has not exhibited symptoms such as gross impairment in thought process or communication, persistent delusions or hallucinations, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living; or disorientation to time or place."
1815740P48S4,,EvidenceSentence,"In this regard, the evidence does not show that the Veteran has severe memory issues such as an inability to remember even his own name or the name of close relatives."
1815740P48S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Although the Veteran reported at the 2015 VA examination that he could not remember the names of his co-workers or the names of the plants he works with, the examiner found that the Veteran had endorsed a number of psychiatric symptoms that are not even claimed among severely ill psychiatric inpatients as well as endorsing a non-credible pattern of somatic and cognitive symptoms that are not reported among individuals with bona fide health disease or cognitive disorders."
1815740P48S6,,EvidenceSentence,"The examiner noted that the Veteran's profile pattern was consistent with individuals who exaggerate or malinger psychiatric, health, and somatic symptoms."
1815740P48S7,,EvidenceSentence,The examiner noted that it is unlikely that the Veteran is experiencing functional impairments with the degree of severity claimed.
1815740P49S2,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, though the Veteran is not comfortable with crowds and becomes agitated when dealing with others, the Veteran is married, attended school (though he has clarified that he took online courses where available and studied alone in the library), and works seasonally."
1815740P49S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, the Veteran has consistently been alert and oriented at all psychiatric evaluations and none of the examiners have indicated he is a persistent danger to himself or others."
1815740P49S4,,ReasoningSentence,"Thus, total social impairment is not demonstrated."
1815740P49S5,,EvidenceSentence,"Moreover, at no point during the appeal have any examiners found that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms result in total occupational and social impairment."
1815740P50S2,ReasoningSentence,EvidenceSentence,"In totality, the record does not show that the Veteran has symptoms that have ever resulted in total occupational and social impairment."
1815740P50S3,,FindingSentence,"Therefore, the Board finds that the criteria for 100 percent schedular disability rating have not been met."
1815740P51S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"Lastly, the Court has held that a request for a total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU), whether expressly raised by Veteran or reasonably raised by the record, is not a separate ""claim"" for benefits, but rather, can be part of a claim for increased compensation."
1815740P51S3,,CitationSentence,"Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009)."
1815740P51S4,,LegalRuleSentence,"In other words, if the claimant or the evidence of record reasonably raises the question of whether the Veteran is unemployable due to a disability for which an increased rating is sought, then part and parcel with the increased rating claim is the issue of whether a TDIU is warranted as a result of that disability."
1815740P51S5,,CitationSentence,Id.
1815740P52S2,,Sentence,"In this case, the Veteran has applied for TDIU, which is addressed in the Remand section below."
1815740P52S3,,Sentence,"As such, the Board will not revisit the issue in this decision."
1815740P53S1,,Sentence,ORDER
1815740P54S2,,Sentence,A disability rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD is denied.
1815740P55S1,,Sentence,REMAND
1815740P56S2,,Sentence,"Entitlement to Service Connection for Obstructive Sleep Apnea, to include as Secondary to Service-Connected Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)"
1815740P57S2,,Sentence,The Veteran is seeking service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.
1815740P57S3,,EvidenceSentence,"A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) does not show that the Veteran was diagnosed with, or treated for, obstructive sleep apnea in service."
1815740P57S4,,FindingSentence,"A review of post-service treatment records show that the Veteran was diagnosed with sleep apnea in August 2014 and is being treated for obstructive sleep apnea and is currently prescribed a CPAP machine to aid with sleeping, though the Veteran finds it uncomfortable and does not utilize it."
1815740P58S2,,EvidenceSentence,"The record shows that the Veteran is claiming service connection as secondary to his service-connected PTSD; however, further development is necessary to determine whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is secondarily caused by the Veteran's PTSD."
1815740P58S3,,EvidenceSentence,"Additionally, with his attorney's May 2017 Brief in Response to 90 Day Letter, the Veteran submitted medical articles linking mental health disorders to sleep disorders, including sleep apnea."
1815740P58S4,,ReasoningSentence,These have not been reviewed by a medical professional.
1815740P58S5,,Sentence,"On remand, the articles must be reviewed to assess whether the Veteran's specific mental health condition has secondarily caused his sleep apnea condition."
1815740P59S2,,Sentence,Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU)
1815740P60S2,,ReasoningSentence,"With respect to the Veteran's claims for TDIU, the Board finds that this claim is inextricably intertwined with his claim seeking service connection for sleep apnea."
1815740P60S3,,Sentence,"Therefore, the appropriate remedy where a pending claim is inextricably intertwined with a claim currently on appeal is to remand the claim on appeal pending the adjudication of the inextricably intertwined claim."
1815740P60S4,,CitationSentence,"Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180 (1991)."
1815740P61S1,,Sentence,"Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:"
1815740P62S2,,Sentence,1.
1815740P62S3,,EvidenceSentence,The Veteran should be scheduled for a VA medical examination to determine the nature and etiology of his current sleep disorder.
1815740P62S4,,EvidenceSentence,Access to the Veteran's electronic VA claims file should be made available to the examiner for review in connection with the examination.
1815740P62S5,,EvidenceSentence,"After reviewing the claims file, the examiner should provide an opinion, with supporting rationale, as to the following:"
1815740P63S2,,FindingSentence,Is it at least as likely as not (a 50 percent probability or greater) that the Veteran's sleep apnea is caused by his service-connected PTSD?
1815740P64S2,,FindingSentence,"If not, is it at least as likely as not (a 50 percent probability or greater) that the Veteran's sleep apnea is aggravated by his service-connected PTSD?"
1815740P65S2,,EvidenceSentence,"In answering these questions, the examiner must review and address the significance of the evidence submitted by the Veteran regarding the potential for a relationship between psychiatric disorders and sleep apnea."
1815740P66S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"The term ""aggravation"" is defined as a chronic worsening of the nonservice-connected condition by the service-connected condition, not merely temporary or intermittent flare-ups."
1815740P67S2,,LegalRuleSentence,"If the sleep apnea is aggravated by the service-connected PTSD, the examiner should indicate the extent of such aggravation by identifying the baseline level of disability prior to aggravation."
1815740P67S3,,ReasoningSentence,"This may be ascertained by the medical evidence of record and also by the Veteran's statements as to the nature, severity, and frequency of his observable symptoms over time."
1815740P68S2,,ReasoningSentence,A complete rationale and reasoning for any opinion rendered must be provided.
1815740P69S2,,Sentence,2.
1815740P69S3,,Sentence,"Thereafter, readjudicate the claims."
1815740P69S4,,Sentence,"If any benefit sought remains denied, the Veteran and his representative should be provided a supplemental statement of the case and given an opportunity to respond before the case is returned to the Board."
1815740P70S2,,Sentence,The Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matters the Board has remanded.
1815740P70S3,,CitationSentence,"Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999)."
1815740P71S2,,Sentence,This claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.
1815740P71S3,,LegalRuleSentence,The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.
1815740P71S4,,CitationSentence,"See 38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5109B, 7112 (2012)."

1815740P75S3,,Sentence,This remand is in the nature of a preliminary order and does not constitute a decision of the Board on the merits of your appeal.
